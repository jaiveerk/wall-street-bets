Ok what's up you fucks? It's u/afitdinosaur coming back at you with some old-school WSB style DD.

&#x200B;

Sit down, shut the fuck up, and close that r/gangbang tab of your wife and her boyfriends, because you're about to get slapped with some **real** deep dick value.

&#x200B;

A few months ago, I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jy3up1/dr_michael_burry_is_gonna_ilumnate_your_portfolio/) DD to WSB outlining how I thought LUMN was the bee's knees. I still think that. There has been some development in the stock since I posted that DD, and I think that y'all deserve an update. Because frankly, the pitiful DD I've seen on LUMN since, one of which references why ""Cables are like the future, man"", and another that had more emojis in it than a tweenage girl's apple chat, is well, unsettling. So you're fucking welcome.

**Act 1: Dr. Christian Bale, PHD, MD.**

For those of you who are too retarded to read my first DD, what initially got me interested in LUMN was a [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761920019679/0001567619-20-019679-index.htm) filed by the one and only Michael Burry, who will henceforth be referred to Dr. Christan Bale, PHD, MD. As seen in the excellent movie The Big Short, Christian Bale is basically an autist who reads approximately 10 million pages of housing loans, and figures out that the trading of [Collateral Debt Obligations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp) on subprime mortgages was going to crash the housing market.  Dr. Bale then buys approximately $1.3 Billion of [Credit Default Swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp), which is a kind of like a bet on a loan defaulting and proceeds to ride the housing market crash to tendie town. Is he the gayest of bears? No he's fucking not. They weren't puts, were they?

Confused about my lazy explanation of both an Academy Award-winning film and complex financial products? I don't fucking care. Google it, or watch the movie. Margot Robbie will explain it all to you, plus she'll get your dick hard. (Or your pussy wet. Idk I've seen some thots around here lately too).

Christian Bale has now increased his position in LUMN, per his last [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761921003819/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml), and it is now his fourth largest holding. Remember that other stock that Bale invested in that helped put u/deepfuckingvalue on the map? What was it called again....? Idr. Oh well. Moving on.

**Act 2: A New Breed**

Ok, with that out of the way, onto the stock TL;DR at the bottom.

LUMN is formerly CenturyLink. Most of you are young enough now to not know that this company used to be shit, and was a part of a dying telecom industry that provided mostly phone lines, and no one except grandma has got phone lines in their house anymore. And grandmas die every day. So, much like the cigarette industry, CenturyLink's customer base was rapidly dwindling. Unlike the cigarette industry, CenturyLink could not replace them faster than they died.

&#x200B;

Until recently.

LUMN has rapidly transitoned to a cutting edge fouth industrial revolution company that is investing heavily in all the cool jazz that the kids love today, like hybrid cloud systems, adaptive network systems, AI driven adaptive threat recognition programs and advanced collaboration systems, which they have recently expanded with a partnership with [ZM](https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/lumen-expands-partnership-zoom).

&#x200B;

Recently, they presented at the Morgan Stanley Technology Summit. I didn't watch that shit, but I guess it went well because the stock rallied almost 8% the day after, despite the market collapsing around it. I meant to post this shit before that summit, but was too busy getting my ass raped by PLTR weeklies to care.

LUMN is now trading at a cool $13.60, up from $9.76 when I first tried to bring you degenerates on board. Not bad for a boomer stock.

On top of this, insiders have been absolutely loading shares, you'd think this stock was [GME](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=lumn&o=&pl=&ph=&ll=&lh=&fd=730&fdr=&td=0&tdr=&fdlyl=&fdlyh=&daysago=&xp=1&vl=25&vh=&ocl=&och=&sic1=-1&sicl=100&sich=9999&grp=0&nfl=&nfh=&nil=&nih=&nol=&noh=&v2l=&v2h=&oc2l=&oc2h=&sortcol=0&cnt=100&page=1), or something.

&#x200B;

**Act 3: Money and All That Shit**

LUMN recently had their Earnings Report. After which, they got fucking obliterated. Personally, I think the finanicals are greatly improving. Let's discuss why, ok?

* Their non GAAP EPS was $0.48 per share, against the estimate of $0.30 per share, beating the average consensus estimate by 37%.
* EBITDA was $8.6B vs $8.9B in 2019.
* Their net income improved from -$5.2B to -$1.2B.
* Operating Expenses were reduced by by almost $570 Million.
* Their net profit margin was improved from a solid -24.33% in 2019 to -5.6% in 2020.

Ratios:

* Price to Sales .51 in 2020 from .66 in 2019.
* Price to Book .96 in 2020 up from 1.07 in 2019.
* Price to Cash Flow 1.61 in 2020 from 2.12 in 2019.

&#x200B;

Don't understand what any of this means? Me either, basically. But know this: LUMN's evaluation ratios are knock any one of their competitors in the 5G industry far, far out of the park. They are a company with a $10B market cap that does sales north of $20B. For comparison, TSLA's Price to Sales ratio is 24.23. If you don't understand why a lower number is better here, fucking google it. Because I lied. I do understand the financials but I'm too lazy to explain it all.

**Act 4: Forward Looking Statements**

Here are some additional reasons why I think this company will make your portfolio super duper green:

* LUMN owns one of the largest fiber networks in the world, with over 450,000 miles of fiber owned in North America alone. They also own the largest fiber network in Asia, where the expected CAGR of 5G Utilization is [46.4%](https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/asia-pacific-5g-enterprise-market-to-witness-massive-growth-by-2024-as-mega-trends-fuel-industry-transformation-870296850.html).
* Asians aren't the only folks LUMN loves they recently hired [Quincy L. Allen](http://blackmillionaires.blogspot.com/2011/08/quincy-l-allen.html) to their board of directors, not only because he's a successful dude, but because, you know, #BLM, as the kids say.
* Companies like AT&T and Verizon will rely heavily on fiber providers to expand the next wave of 5G, which, as you cool kids know, is the next bee's knees. There have been some unsubstanitated chatter of a potential buyout by AT&T. But take that shit with a grain of rice. Still, with how cheap options still are on LUMN, it's worth the gamble IMO.
* There has been a steady increase in [Darkpool Prints](https://twitter.com/darkpoolcharts/status/1364034343480545280) on LUMN since February of this year. For those of you who don't know what darkpool trades are, basically, folks with huge amounts of money will trade stocks on a private exchange because the size would otherwise throw the equity price out of whack on the public markets. Like, a lot of money. Like, more than you fucks who bought into GME at $400 have made so far.
* LUMN is prime to drop a bomb in the the near future. There was a lot, a lot of attention at the MS Tech Summit and LUMN got some attention, as previously mentioned above. Options volume has spiked, and the Put to Call ratio is a respectable .14. Bottom line, not alot of gaybears in the LUMN camp.
* There's a chance of a big upcoming catalyst at any turn with LUMN. However, I think the safe move here, and the best way to generate TENDIES, is leaps. For those of you who don't know what leaps are, they're pretty much the opposite of FD's. **It is possible to buy an option that expires farther than this friday, not sure if you fucks knew that.**

And yes, Sir, I know this is a casino. **I'm giving you a sure why to beat the house.** Currently, an ATM option for JANUARY 2022 is $1.75. This is cheap, folks. Real fucking cheap. I've got options that have been fucking printing since December. If you're a real tendie tickler, try leap call spreads. Set and fucking forget. [For the price of 4 GME shares, LUMN could net you $25k](http://opcalc.com/rlE). That's definitely enough to tell your wife's bf you're sleeping at the foot of the bed instead of a couch. In a year.

**Act 5: Don't Eat the Crayons**

Ok time for some chart astrology you fucks. As you can see [here,](https://imgur.com/YvMsoZy) we've got LUMN on the 10, hourly, and daily charts. For you robinhooders out there, there are things called candle sticks and technical indica-...fuck, nevermind. It's too complicated. Just keep yoloing your stimmies into GME FD's. It'll work out I promise. TBH it probably will you degenerates are a wild bunch. I hope you all make millions.

Anyhoo:

* The 10 is showing relative consolidation, with an arguable inverted head and shoulders, and had a strong move upward when RSI traded into the oversold range. there were multiple tests of the 200 EMA (purplish), 50 EMA, (yellowish), and 20 EMAS today in this time frame. LUMN held VWAP until about 10AM central when it dumped below it and traded under VWAP until it spiked up to retest VWAP after hours. A push over VWAP ($13.68) in PM tomorrow could set LUMN up for a strong pump at open for all you daytraders out there. MACD ended in the bullish/nuetral territory.
* Hourly is showing signs of a reversal if we can get strong out of the gate and get through the several levels of resistance: $13.19 at 200 EMA, $13.68 at VWAP, $13.73 at 20 EMA and $13.76 at the 50 EMA. RSI is still in the low to nuetral oversold territory at 45.50. MACD is getting ready to curl bullish and I think LUMN will be strong tomorrow. Volume Profile (not pictured) has strong resistance at $13.83, but over that we could get real fiesty.
* Despite the daily MACD curling bearish, and RSI being in the higher range of overbought, I'd argue we're seeing a small bull flag on the daily. Volume movement also makes me think bull flag, but be aware of the general market sentiment and get ready to play both sides of the coin.

&#x200B;

Ok Autists, you may be missing a chromosome, or might have an extra, or maybe I'm thinking of something totally different, but this one's a no brainer for me. Watch the price action and go long when the opportunity arises. Since my last post, LUMN experienced a sympathy squeeze from GME which drove the price up to $16.60. Since I'm no u/deepfuckingvalue, I cashed the fuck out of most of my earlier posted calls because I paid pennies for them and sold them for dollars. However, I still hold July, November and January 2022/2023 calls and spreads.

This is a smart play folks. Which might be sacrilege on WSB these days, but nothing will be unVALEd or turn PRPL in your portfolio and you will be able to afford to eat more than CORN. The only thing that will happen if you join the LUMN gain is green tendies and fucking caviar. #ganggang.

&#x200B;

TL:DR- Buy LUMN calls, leaps and shares. Did I mention there's a 7% div?

&#x200B;

Postions:

Curaleaf ($CURLF) just crushed quarterly earnings and as far as I can tell, no other company is even close;

Total Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was a record $230.3 million, an increase of 205.1% compared to $75.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Total Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased 26.2% sequentially.

This is mostly because of their thirsty executive team re-investing their profits to expand to every state possible in the US.  They also just recently announced a European acquisition making them only one of 2 companies legally selling in the two largest markets in the world with ambitions of also opening up in Africa as well.

They are already the biggest company in the US, will soon be the biggest in the world.

One of the other issues facing the US industry as a whole is banking.  Because weed is still illegal, most companies have a hard time renting or purchasing spaces.  If the owner of the building has a mortgage with Wells Fargo or JP Morgan, the building is basically unavailable.  This is why cannabis REITS have been crushing it this year.  The Senate Majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has recently rekindled the idea about passing the SAFE act.  This would allow these companies to use major banks if they are in legal states.  Besides the fact that this would enhance their ability to set up shop around the US, think about what this could mean for companies looking to go global like Curaleaf.

I don't know if legalization is around the corner, but frankly I don't care.  Regardless of what government does, Curaleaf is going to find a way to move their product around the world and own the market.  If the government does move towards legalization, moving onto any US based cannabis company will be a good play.

EXPI,"I know most of you are a bit tied up on capital with GME at the moment, but for those of you who have some spare cash and are more value oriented, this DD is for you. 


**Background:**

I'm going to be talking about eXp World Holdings Inc ($EXPI). EXPI provides many products, but most notably their cloud brokerage firm, eXp realty. Per yahoo finance: ""eXp operates as a cloud-based real estate brokerage firm. It focuses on the development and use of cloud-based technologies in order to grow an international brokerage without the burden of physical brick and mortar offices and redundant staffing costs. The firm offers offers software subscriptions to customers to access its virtual reality software platform through VirBELA.""

The stock has seen a 52 week range of $3.26 - $90.00 and is currently sitting at $52.00 after hours post earnings (up ~13% on the day). Their market cap is right about 6B.


**Earnings:**

They absolutely crushed earnings, some notable details:

- Revenue increased 122% from Q4 2019 -> Q4 2020, with the result of a record high - $609.3 million
- 15% increase in agents and brokers on the platform in Q4 2020 compared to Q3
- A record annual net income of $31 million

**The juicy deets:**

Ok, so now we have the background and some numbers, let's see why this is such an attractive stock. The competitors of EXPI include players like; Redfin (RDFN) - 7.91B market cap and Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) - 8.96B market cap.

Both of those are at least 1.5 billion more in market cap, with technology that is far behind what eXp is offering. Traditional real estate brokerages can't even be taken seriously when comparing, because they lack the technology side of things that EXPI offers. Hell, EXPI literally owns a VR platform for creating 3D virtual office environments. Which that part of their business is not even remotely being reflected in their stock price. 

It's more fair to compare EXPI to the tech startups that are upwards of 10B market cap. Looking at it from that perspective, we see a 4 billion dollar upside. Or a share price of ~$71.

That share price of $71 falls right into the 52 week range I stated at the beginning of the post and is what I consider an accurate value for this stock. The technical analysis from myself and others clearly shows this price target forming:

https://ibb.co/dL6brDg

https://ibb.co/Sx16QGx

RSI and MACD are both turning up after a long downtrend from the ATH (90 -> ~35). It found support around 40 and has bounced off of that up to $45 leading into earnings, which as stated before, were excellent. That caused the price to blow past the breakout area of ~51-52 during the AH session. 

This ship is headed for $70 very soon. It is certainly not going to be a GME type event where a 1500% return is seen, but a 40-50% gain on a company with good financials and future is something I certainly won't miss. 

I'm not a financial adviser, I just like the stock. 

Position: 61 shares @ $45

Edit: I've got a couple questions in comments and dm's about the bear case. Adding my take on this here. 

Bear case - 

Market writes them off as a traditional real estate brokerage, e.g. doesn't account for (or simply doesn't care about) the value add that EXPI brings to the table. In that case, EXPI is overvalued at $50 and true share price is around $30-$40. 

I highly disagree with that view point, obviously, but that's the perspective I'd take if I was in a short position.

They'll need to continue to show growth on their cloud platform(s) to invalidate the above thesis. This most recent earnings was a great example of them invalidating the short thesis by showing 15% growth on their cloud brokerage platform and record revenue numbers.

Double edit:

You beautiful autists who picked up shares and calls during the morning dips are true retards. Some of you are already looking at 100%+ gainz.

Triple edit:

Interest rate volatility is fucking us. I sold off at $59 for some quick gainz and bought back in at $46. Positions now are 20 shares @ ~$46 and 10 4/16 $60c @ 1.50 strike. I still stand by the thesis here, *unless there is a market wide correction due to interest rates.* Play anything in real estate / tech / growth very carefully right now.","EXPI crushed earnings, $70 share price inbound",m35usn,78,97,0.87,97,0,,DD,False,True,-1

Since this original posting on March 6th we've seen very strong macro-economic movement in the markets at large:

\-Treasure auctions have went well  
[\-10 yr bond](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y?countrycode=bx) going up slightly by no one freaking

[Perhaps the largest possible positive catalyst is the proposed DTCC liquidity rule.](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/important-notices?subsidiary=NSCC&pgs=1) When this rule is approved by regulators, SEC, it will be announced with an implementation date. It's likely they're fast tracking this. They announced the proposed rule last Friday March 5th. There is a possibility if they truly believe there is systemic risk that they may announce an implementation date tomorrow for... March 18th. You can keep an eye for the announcement here. The fastest I've seen them implement rules in the past was one month from proposal... So, if they really want this... March 18th is likely the soonest. 

The implications of the new rule have been widely debated but I think it is fair consensus to say that it will require market participants to post more collateral as their underlying positions becoming more risky and/or require settlement. It will mean a lot of HFs under water can't just double down and hide in the 21 day liquidity cycle. The GME fiasco unveiled a lot of systemic risk to the system which is why they cut our tendies off.  


After this rule passes it's entirely likely the short-interest players change forever and there will never be another GME situation where any one fund takes such incredibly risk. It will be a healthy change for the markets.   


Now as hedge funds DO NOT KNOW when this rule will be implemented it is very likely we are seeing some aggressive covering for the smart players that do not want to be crowded out in the event of a surprise date. The implementation date is not likely to be the tipping point... It will probably be much sooner.   


OK let's look at how our stonks are doing:  


**$GME**  


https://preview.redd.it/d0pbsl9wuhm61.png?width=1737&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d4e84906ffc0020411419c541040a5a8ff941ae

Gamestop is in the midst of a massive shift to eCommerce and what's so amazing about this entire story is we have a massively over-shorted company AND a very likely turn around story. The market doesn't understand the potential of GME. This price action is not just about a squeeze, it's about defining the company as a multiple of sales (which is how other eCom companies are valued). In this instance eCom companies are getting 5-15 multiples of SALES. Gamestop also is living in a RAPIDLY EXPANDING MARKET and being led by a young, successful and capable leader Ryan Cohen. Short squeeze aside current market cap of GME is $18B at $250 a share. At $5B a year in sales as an eCom company that's a valuation of $50B on the LOW SIDE... This already supports a $500 share price in itself. I absolutely believe Gamestop can pull this off.   


The BEST part of this story was that DFV and Reddit WERE RIGHT about this massively undervalued company! Turns out retail investors aren't dumb- they're just retarded.  


**$BB**

  


https://preview.redd.it/dqkb0fgxvhm61.png?width=1742&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba4cc2b236e1e13ea4267fda849fd645175fe312

  
Blackberry is another amazing retail find. With a market cap of only $6 billion it's shaping up to be at the center of the internet-of-things electric vehicle. They're announcing partnerships out of their ying-yang and are looking to be the android for EV vehicles with their IVY platform. The reason they are not trading higher is because they have not demonstrated revenue growth to the street and big funds need that to buy in. That's OK because it gives everyone else a massive early buying opportunity. What's more is the chart is starting to show considerable support under $11. After $11 for March 12th and Marth 19th we have a huge amount of options ready to be triggered.

Check out THIS AMAZING trending chart action. AMC is ready to go UP! The shorts thought AMC would be a nice casuality of the pandemic and then reddit swarmed in to save the day. Turns out people like going to the movies. They just had a better-than-expected earnings call too and guess what... They have $1B in cash.   


AMC president said they have literally a year of block-buster amazing movies queued up to keep us buying over priced popcorn every day of the week. And guess what... I'm tired of watching movies from my couch. People realize theatres are awesome and it's the #2 American thing to do besides go out to eat (which you need to do).   


Short story is the options chain on this and momentum is undeniably strong. This is ready to go to $20.  


Once again Reddit is actually right about a great up and coming company!

The chart of Nokia is a chart of incredible sadness. Kudos to any Nokia investor. But where there is a dark-horse there is an under-dog story. Turns out Biden and his team aren't big fans of China Tech and with US leadership we're seeing anti-China tech policies emerge. Eric Schmid of Google says 5G dominance in the US is a must and will require massive investment to ensure the US has the next generation internet companies ready to compete on a world scale. So far domestically China is way ahead with their deployment of 5G meaning the Chinese are going to invest hardcore in creating these new 5G companies. The world is changing.  


[Now that Biden is done with stimulus his next plan is infrastructure.](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/)Do you know what a big part of his infrastructure plan will be? 5g.   


* **Expanding broadband, or wireless broadband via 5G, to every American** – recognizing that millions of households without access to broadband are locked out of an economy that is increasingly reliant on virtual collaboration. Communities without access cannot leverage the next generation of “smart” infrastructure. As the COVID-19 crisis has revealed, Americans everywhere need universal, reliable, affordable, and high-speed internet to do their jobs, participate equally in remote school learning and stay connected. This digital divide needs to be closed everywhere, from lower-income urban schools to rural America, to many older Americans as well as those living on tribal lands. Just like rural electrification several generations ago, universal broadband is long overdue and critical to broadly shared economic success.

  
The leaders in the world for 5G technology are Ericcson, Nokia and Hawuii. Ericcson has a market cap of 2x Nokia for no good reason.   


**Nokia is about to get noticed in a big way... Oh and there are 140,000... yes THOUSAND... call contracts at $5 on March 18th.**

Rocket IPOd in September 2020 and has been controlled by the shorts ever since. Check out this chart of amazing disappointment. Every time something good happened to RKT like their earnings blowing expectations by 100% they were strangled down again.   


The truth is RKT is a best in class fin-tech disruptor with 9% of the mortgage market and a bunch of future loan-related services on the way. They also made $10 BILLION in profit and are only valued around $50 billion.   


Lately people were all worried about rising interest rates but the [CEO says to calm the fuck down because either way they're banking boat loads of money.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-ceo-downplays-rising-153042831.html)  


Short interest, depending on who you ask, is still around 30%. Oh and check out the open call interest for March 19th:

This options chain is what I call a feed-back-happy-day because as the $30 strike is triggered it will drive all the way up to the $50s... This thing is LOADED.  


Once again Reddit has found a great under-valued company with it's price suppressed for months and a loaded options chain ready to take this to the moon. RKT is absolutely my favorite for short term potential if GME is too seemingly expensive for you to enter. RKT price is totally low and you won't regret buying.

\*\*\*  


**TLDR:**  
There are SOME AMAZING coming catalysts that will increase the momentum on all these stocks. The reason they are moving is because Reddit is RIGHT! There is serious under-value here.

Now regarding the free money with JD. It’s time to buy the dip on this. I’m recommending ITM calls [75-85 strike] expiring late April. This is just my recommendation for a good combination of upside potential and risk control. This is also a great company for leaps or stock. Hoping for a down day tomorrow to swoop up some calls. 

JD is the sleeper E-Commerce giant of China. (Though it has a reach in many markets) Most people know it’s competitor Alibaba, but I can assure you, JD is a fucking Titan. They are on-track to taking a lot of market share from Alibaba in a densely populated market. 

JD has the best optimized supply chain in China’s E-Commerce market. They’ve spent a lot more time the past decade mastering the supply chain prior to pushing for growth, but I assure you that growth is here. JD has a number of subsidiaries, they all see huge growth, and most importantly they all make money. Alibaba posts a number of losses with its failed or poor performing subsidiaries, and will never overtake JD on supply chain performance. The fact they perform so well, and have entered both new and innovative markets and succeeded, just shows the strength of their management and future. 

I track a lot of institutional purchase points on stocks. The most recent filings show the 80-90 point range on JD as a major purchasing point. We also saw much less of a sell off on some of the final days the S&P posted major losses once in this range, further validating the price floor. 

JD is trading below all targets, and has strong institutional backing. 

JD just posted Q4 results, and as always at open we say a unprecedented sell-off this morning. This has become a regular thing for some unknown reason, which is why I don’t ever hold through earnings. It’s a gamble with no logic these days. I do look for these post-earnings drops in solid companies though, because they provide great buy points. JD beat expectations in all categories for Q4. JD’s revenue is up over 30% from last year to 34 Billion this quarter. I straight up laugh reading through their earning calls, it’s fucking unreal how much growth they see from a financial and user activity standpoint. 

A lot of analysts love saying how it’s just the CV-19 situation that has primarily driven its growth, and that afterwards a large portion of this growth will fall off. They’re fucking idiots. The market in China is huge, we might see a slight drawback, but you don’t stop this type of growth, especially in the Chinese market. It’s just now becoming normal for the lower class in China to have cellphones, opening up a huge market, and the entire country knows who JD is, including the poors and the olds. Want to know why? JD was used by the Chinese government to distribute aid through their applications and services. It’s was essentially a free, government endorsed, country wide PR and marketing opportunity that no ad could ever beat. It also targets the market they want to reach. Can’t make this shit up.

RAVN,"Hi cock suckers and carpet munchers. We’ve all been hearing about the recovery plays in oil, infrastructure, casinos, restaurants and so on. The one I have not been hearing about as much is the big recovery as it relates to the agriculture stonks. Figured I would give you all a few more ideas to chew on. 

The last few years have been absolute shit for farmers, with many of them going bankrupt or barely scraping by. Some of this is due to poor environmental conditions, some of it was trade war related, and the pandemic compounded all of those already existing problems. 

Where we are now - shit is getting back on track. A lot of this has to do with China and their need to rebuild their pork population. For those who don’t know, Chinese pigs got fucked by a quiet pandemic in 2019 - African Swine Fever. This causes them to buy a lot of soybeans and corn to feed all those fuckin pigs, sending the futures flying. We had a corn gang a little while ago, but this is now spreading to the rest of the farm. 

USDA is projecting a record number of acres to be planted this year in response to the demand, and with the Chinese showing no signs of slowing down, in addition to the volatile weather wiping out crops at random, farmers need to keep production higher as well. China is essentially back in full force post pandemic, and the US is just really starting to see the first signs of normalcy. This only adds to the demand and for different kinds of crops. 

On a separate note, there is a rediscovery of the outdoors and personal farming has been taking off. The booming weed industry can also give the general farming industry a boost as that will require all of the same inputs. 

Things like farming equipment, fertilizers, etc. are in high demand. There isn’t one specific way to play this so I will list a few solid names from each category. Some of these stocks have run up, but let’s be real - what fucking hasn’t at this point? This is a cyclical boom in all things farming that can last for a very long time.

Positions-

PT,"**TLDR**: iStar owns $2.5B of SAFE shares, $3.1B in other assets yielding 8% (3.2B of debt which costs 4%), yet a *market cap of $1.3B*.  iStar should trade 2x from here, with a few possible catalysts that could get some attention.

# Summary

iStar (STAR) is a REIT in transition moving assets to their ground leasing company called SAFE. There is a massive mispricing between the two intertwined companies. **iStar's market cap is $1.3B yet owns $2.5B worth of SAFE** *and* **$3.1B worth of assets yielding 7.9%.** As of Q4, there was only $50M of non-performing assets. This is trading at nearly an 80% discount!

# iStar’s SAFE investment ($2.5B):

iStar created the ground leasing company SAFE in 2017, which is a REIT that owns ground leases, not buildings. There is already a lot written about SAFE, so I'm not going to summarize that; instead I'll focus on the mispricing. iStar owns 34.8M shares of SAFE currently valued at $2.5B ($73 / share)( [Slide 11](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008) ). Based solely on iStars SAFE holding, **iStar should trade at $34.25 a share**($2.5B of SAFE/ 74M iStar shares outstanding).

Is SAFE legit? Goldman thinks so with a recently initiated $101 price target (Jan 2021), with a street average of $90 a share. If SAFE reached Goldman’s PT, this would translate to an iStar holding of $3.5B in SAFE. Based on **Goldman’s SAFE Price target**, **iStar should trade at $47.10** a share, some 268% where it trades now.

At this point, the mispricing is so stark that **if you bought $73 of iStar** (i.e. 1 share of SAFE), you would get ***1.93 shares of SAFE***\*, plus iStar’s other underlying assets worth some $3B in other assets

# iStar’s Other Assets($3.1B):

iStar breaks out their other lines of business into three buckets:

* Net Lease Consolidated Assets: $2.162B yielding 7.9% ([Slide 12](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008), Q4 report)
* Net Lease Venture II: 300M yielding 9% ([Slide 13](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008), Q4 report)
* Real Estate Finance Portfolio: $646M at 7.2% ([Slide 15](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008), Q4 report).

In total, they have only $52M of non-performing assets. These assets total **$3.1B yielding 7.9%.**

# iStar’s Liabilities ($3.2B):

iStar is a REIT, so leverage is the name of the game. Debt, net of cash is $3.2B meaning if iStar disposed on their ""Other Assets"" they would be net neutral. The times iStar has offloaded assets, they received far more than what their book indicated [Link](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/istar-announces-the-completion-of-the-sale-of-its-preferred-freezer-net-lease-assets-300878208.html). iStar wouldn't do that as the cost of debt is \~4% while they are yielding some 8%. This debt is \~1.1x leveraged when including SAFE.  

# Upcoming catalysts:

I strongly feel it's a matter of time before the market realizes this massive price discrepancy. Here are some possible events:

* **Goldman initiated coverage on SAFE on January 27th, 2021**. Why not cover iStar if they own 63% of SAFE?
* Three major assets of iStar are Asbury Park, Magnolia Green and Grand Vista. They are looking sell these off over the next 2 years. This would be a massive cash event that could trigger a large iStar share repurchase program or make a move private more seamless.
* iStar has been trying to simplify its message by selling off legacy (though high quality) assets. iStar is nearly complete with this process and plans to begin messaging this year
* SAFE x STAR One-Stop Capital Program was launched in Q4. This combines deals that allow companies to ground lease through SAFE, then allow iStar to offer financing. This could offer some additonal topline growth and further prove their business model is scalable and synergistic between iStar and SAFE going forward.

There is a lot of information already out on iStar and SAFE. I'm a big believer in the SAFE and iStar business models, though my intention here is to highlight the massive price discrepancy between the two stocks.

ASO,"First DD so go easy on me. First off lets go over the financials. Full 2021 FY numbers arent complete yet so I'll put the 2020 numbers. Note these numbers maybe a little inflated over current ones.

EPS: 1.363 ; PE: 18.35

BVPS: 11.18 ; PB: 2.237

What other company in this space trades at similar numbers. $FL does (18.45, 2.118). Thats a good sign, its trading like a company with twice the market cap. The difference being $ASO is regional and $FL (inter?)national. I see this as a bonus to the side of $ASO. It can focus more on the unique aspects of its customers and capitalize on *cough* guns *cough* those products. Contrarily, to the side of $FL, it does have a 1.4% dividend yield that is built into the price as well. 

Next question to ask is how well they have transitioned to the online economy that has dominated 2020 and will dominate in the non distant future? Introducing new board member Tom Nealon. Currently president of Southwest Airlines and previously served as EVP, CIO of JC Penney, (*record scratch* wait the JCPenney that got shat on by the pandemic? Oh no. . . lets keep reading.) from 2006 to 2010. *phew* dodged a bullet there. So it seems like he's actually good at his job and not a monke 🐵. With that being said it seems like they've already done better than your average brick and mortar during the pandemic, they have beat earnings in Q3 and I think they will again in Q4.

So now that we have reason to believe it's properly priced and there's room to grow from here lets get to the fun part. This stock is a time bomb, we hear it beeping but the LCD screen broke so we cant see the time left. Its 40% short and the shorts have been continuing to short as the price increases, hmm I've seen this one before. We will probably see 45-50% short on the next report date. 

There's no guaranty anything will squeeze. But at some point in the future the stock will be overpriced which means tendies and if it does squeeze, a lot of them. It will need a catalyst to squeeze but either way its a good investment

QQQ,"The biggest story this month in mainstream finance media was the sudden spike in the interest rate for 10 year US government bonds and the effect it was having on the stock market. In this edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we’ll be taking a look at why the 10-year interest rate is important, how it has led to rising asset prices over the past few decades (i.e. creating an asset bubble), and how GME is involved with all of this.

[Ray Dalio’s Thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhrkwu/a_smooth_brained_guide_to_ray_dalios_thesis/)

**What is the 10-year US treasury and why is the yield so important?**

The 10 year treasury is an IOU sold by the US government when it needs to borrow money, promising to pay it back in 10 years with regular interest payment in the meantime. They auction off these bonds to the highest bidder, and the price that these bonds get sold off at determines the yield of these bonds. In finance, US bonds are considered to be a risk-free asset, since it’s the safest possible investment anyone can make (at least in theory). Because of this, the 10 year US bond yield is considered to be the “risk free rate” for any long-term investments and acts as gravity towards any other riskier investments.

**Why does the 10-year affect the price of every other asset?**

As a rule of thumb, the riskier an asset is, the higher return (or yield) that asset will need to provide. For things like bonds, are pretty straight-forward - it’s the yield, or effective interest rate that bond provides. For things like equities (stocks), it’s a bit more complicated. As a hand-wavy approach, a lot of people use Earnings, so let’s go with that. % return demanded by investors = earnings / price, meaning price is inversely proportional to % return, or **if % return demanded 📈 price 📉** **and vice versa**.

This is how the treasury yields affect the price of literally everything else (except GME), from real estate to SPY. Suppose that JPow decided overnight that he changed his mind and managed to pump up the 10-year rate to 10%, which is where it was at for most of the 1980s. Compared to SPY, which is maybe giving you a return of 2.5% (based on the current PE ratio of 40), any 🦍 with more than two brain cells can figure out the better deal. So everyone sells their SPY and loads up on treasuries until SPY drops enough (i.e. falls 75%) to at very least match the return of the 10-year, and likely even more due to the increased risk and volatility (risk premium).

[S&P 500 Earnings Yield vs. 10Y Treasury Yield](https://preview.redd.it/pg68b4n39hm61.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=457e43c3379aa0cef7424de824904d2c8f66e556)

There’s several other mechanisms that this rate affects various asset prices as well

1. Housing prices - For the same reasons, a rise in the 10-year = a rise in mortgage rates. So if the prime mortgage rate doubles from 3% (today) to 6%, to buy the same $250K house, a 30-year mortgage will go from a $1000 monthly payment to a $1500 monthly payment, which might be more than what people looking at $250K houses can afford. This would thus cause a decline in housing prices until the people who would’ve previously bought those houses can afford it again.
2. Stock buybacks - A low 10-year = low corporate bond yields = incentivizes businesses to take on the cheap debt, even if they don’t need it. What do they do with that excess capital? Usually, stock buybacks or dividend payments, which drives up their own stock prices - something executives are especially incentivized to do since their compensation is usually tied to stock price performance. What happens when the 10-year and corporate bond interest rates go back up? Those companies who took on a bunch of debt probably won’t refinance their bonds when they expire, and will need to divert their resources from dividend and stock buybacks to paying down their debt, possibly even issuing more shares to raise capital to pay it back, lowering their stock price.
3. Leverage - Treasury rates set the bar for the lowest interest rates someone can borrow at, including hedge funds to borrow cash to buy stocks on margin. To dumb it down, if a hedge fund finds some combination of trades that yield a 5% return with low risk and can borrow from their broker at 2%, they could lever up 10x (theyre not subject to the 2x leverage limit retail investors have) and get a 50% return while paying 20% in interest. What happens when treasury rates go up, causing their interest rates they pay to their brokerage go up? They sell those holdings, and since most funds are net-bullish on the market, this usually means a mass sell-off in the stock market.

**How the Fed controls the 10-year yield**

The Fed’s official mission is to

1. Ensure price stability, this usually means that they target a 2% inflation rate
2. Try to achieve “full employment”, which is basically the lowest unemployment rate that's practically achievable

They achieve this through two mechanisms.

1. The Fed Funds Rate - This is what they use during normal times. This is basically the interest rates the banks within the Federal Reserve System lends to each other overnight, which they can set a ceiling and floor to by establishing a rate that any bank can borrow or lend the Fed at any time
2. Quantitative Easing / Tightening - This is an unconventional tool they usually resort to once the Fed Funds Rate reaches zero (for Easing) to further stimulate the economy to further pump liquidity by directly buying Treasuries / government bonds, and sometimes other assets like Mortgage Backed Securities and Corporate Bonds.

It’s pretty obvious from above how the Fed can affect the 10-year note, especially with quantitative easing, where they might directly buy it, causing the price to decrease from an increased demand and reducing the yield as a result.

**What Happened Last Week**

So what happened with the 10-year yield last week? It **🚀 🌝**, which for reasons mentioned above, means that everything else **📉.**

[10Y Treasury Yield, Daily](https://preview.redd.it/luroj2b79hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ad89ea67d4e86e555d39008d51d5cdc8fa8ec0d)

*Why did the 10-year yield* ***🚀 🌝***\*?\*

Basically, there was a lot of speculation recently that we might see inflation as the economy opens up.

*Why does the economy reopening = inflation?*

There’s this macroeconomic theory called the Quantity Theory of Money - ***MV = PQ***, where M is the quantity of Money in the system, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the GDP. A rise in P = inflation.

In this equation, the key variable is the velocity of money, which is the speed at which money circulates in an economy, or in other words, how fast consumers will spend a dollar once they earn it. Interestingly enough, ever since the 2000s, and especially after the 2008 recession, velocity of money has been steadily declining, mostly due to rising income inequality as richer people tend to spend money less quickly than poorer people who might be living paycheck to paycheck. However, when COVID hit, it really 📉 fast.​

[Velocity of M2 Money](https://preview.redd.it/j7mi0ed99hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=34d61275d0dc17bfbd82e6a16c3dc7beb1751a0e)

So with Q (GDP) and M (Money Supply) being equal, this would generally mean P going down as well, or in other words, deflation - the Fed’s worst nightmare. How do central banks combat this? By increasing M proportionally to the decrease in V.

[M2 Money Stock](https://preview.redd.it/hdg62w7b9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=78de5d86fb81951af79939159662a0a442dc28dc)

*By what mechanism does the Fed increase M?*

Using the two mechanisms described above. Right when COVID hit, they immediately dropped the Fed Funds Rate to 0. They quickly realized that wasn’t enough, and started buying government and corporate bonds on-mass until they were confident it would prevent deflation. This has the side-effect of decreasing the 10-year yield, and making all other assets go up. If you look closely, though you’ll see that they really turned off the printing press after the summer.

So, what happens when the economy opens back up? V goes up, maybe back to normal. So the Fed has two options according to the Quantity Theory of Money

1. Let M (money supply) stay where it is. This means that P will go up, or in other words, inflation
2. Prevent inflation by decreasing M. This will have the opposite effect of what was described above, and sending the 10-year yields 📈 and all asset prices **📉**

[Fed Balance Sheet](https://preview.redd.it/h9buyb8g9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=33fe1010414625a0fa585b18d144d4a396ec86ee)

*What did JPowell say?*

He basically confirmed what everyone was thinking - **inflation is coming**. However, he did say that he was comfortable letting inflation go above its 2% target until jobs recover and the Fed achieves its second mandate - full employment.

*Why did what he say cause yields to go up regardless?*

Basically, people were expecting him to announce that he was going to turn the money printer back on and increase the number of treasury purchases to force the 10-year yield back down. He did not do that, which indicates that he’s changing his stance to actually try to be careful to not overheat the economy, and that he might actually be worried about inflation since he went against what the entire market assumed he would do, and priced in to do.

At very least, this means that we probably shouldn’t be counting on the Fed’s money printer continuously driving up asset prices anytime soon. In the medium term, if inflation does get bad enough, it shows at least some willingness from the Fed that they may actually intervene and decrease the money supply - causing everything else to crash alongside it. Will it happen? Well that depends on how bad this inflation gets, and how bad the Fed is willing to stand by and watch it happen until they do something.

**Why I am a 🌈🐻 in the medium term**

The re-opening might force the Fed to do something that they haven’t done in a very long time - quantitative tightening.

If you look closely at these charts, you can put yourself in the shoes of the Fed and see why stonks only went 📈 in the past decade.

* The 2008 recession caused a permanent decline in velocity of money that has never actually really recovered - likely due to the increased income inequality that never reversed since then
* Decreased velocity of money = decreased P, or deflation, in the long term with all things equal
* To avoid this, the Fed drops the Fed Funds rate to 0, followed by quantitative easing on treasuries, dropping their yield as well, to increase the money supply to keep the inflation rate near their target
* Since velocity of money never really recovered, they just left the money they pumped in and the low interest rates they set at the 2008 recession there and barely touched it until 2017, where they slowly raised it until they abruptly stopped in 2018 - we’ll get to what happened when they did that in a bit
* With all this extra liquidity in the system keeping the 10-year low, when the economy did eventually recover from the 2008 recession, all asset prices, including the stock market and real estate prices **🚀 🌝** for virtually every year - except for 2018 - we’ll also get to that in a bit

**What Happened in 2018?**

[SPY, near 2018](https://preview.redd.it/efjhgufw9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e99c92f0e9f22bf26f2f8bf17e9c740021b6c27)

[Fed Funds Rate, near 2018](https://preview.redd.it/woz6w4ww9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e539f1f4ef0ea0a96a90e0c59dd766b603087ff1)

Throughout 2017, but especially in 2018, the Fed finally decided to slowly start increasing the Fed Funds rate back up from basically 0%, almost 10 years after the 2008 recession; the first quantitative tightening we’ve since then. So, what happened in 2018? First, the [yield curve inverted](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/the-us-bond-yield-curve-has-inverted-heres-what-it-means.html) (meaning the 10 year yield fell below the 3 month yield), possibly the most reliable forward indicator of an oncoming recession - in the past 50 years, every recession has happened within 2 years of a yield curve inversion, and every yield curve inversion has been followed by a recession within 2 years except for one false positive. This is usually a signal of lack of confidence in investors in asset prices, which in turn caused the stock market to crash, leading to one of the only >1% decline year in the S&P500 since 2009.

So my thesis for is that in the next few years, one of the following must happen

* Velocity of Money never recovers to pre-COVID levels. TBH this is probably the best case scenario for the stock market, but is probably REALLY bad for the economy. The only way for this to really happen is we remain in a K-shaped recovery, where we continue to have high-unemployment for lower paying jobs and high income inequality
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, the Fed either continues quantitative easing or does not do quantitative tightening. This will eventually lead to inflation well above the Fed’s 2% target. JPowell has shown so far that although he would accept this temporarily without doing any action but left the door open for quantitative tightening if he sees sustained over-inflation, which is possible (and imo likely) given the amount of money pumped into the economy over the year + how much the velocity of money dropped last year.
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, and the Fed decides to do some sort of quantitative tightening in the medium term after seeing sustained over-inflation. If this happens, we will find out how much of the last decade’s stock market gains were from real productivity increases, and how much of it was from the Fed’s monetary policy.

*What do I think? Short term, anything can happen so no I'm not buying SPY puts again. I am, however, not going long on anything outside of a 6 month time frame. Why? Ask yourself this - what do you really think has been the primary driver of the stock market's rise over the past decade: Fundamental economic growth? Or is it the Fed's money printing. Now, ask yourself, how long can that driver keep going for? The money printer was on overdrive the past few months to compensate for COVID; how long could this last until we see inflation and it forces JPowell to turn off the printer?*

***TLDR; Stonks only go 📈 if you have the Fed on your side. If the Fed ever decides (or needs to) changes sides, bulls r fucked***

**Why GME 🚀 🌝 when everything else 📉**

Not really related to the thesis, and [I briefly talked about this a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/), but it seems to be what everyone talks about nowadays so I guess I’ll talk about this too. I’m sure some of y’all have noticed that every time every other stock goes down, GME usually 📈 and vice versa, and especially wrinkly brained ape [did the math](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lteecj/gme_may_have_the_potential_to_dictate_the_course/) and found a statistically significant inverse correlation between GME and the rest of the stock market. Why is that? Well, in short

1. Virtually nobody buying GME now is doing so because of earnings yield / they did a DCF on the company and thought that it was undervalued at $50 based on future cash flows, so the 10-year yield increasing is meaningless to them
2. Institutions / Hedge Funds that are on the other side of the trade need to de-gross their books whenever the stock market goes down. In short, some hedge funds tend to take an insane amount of leverage (eg. the mean gross leverage of a hedge fund is around 8x right now). They can do this because their “net exposure”, which is their long exposure - short exposure is much lower, and isn’t as risky because they are “hedged” vs. market conditions. Gross exposure, on the other hand, is the total value of long and short positions they hold. So, if they sell off a long position, they need to sell a short position if they’ve levered up in this way, and vice versa. It’s pretty well known that hedge funds love big tech stocks and like shorting AMC and GME. So, if they exit out of their tech / growth longs to reduce their gross leverage, they’ll also need to cover their GME shorts as well.

Now for some DD. Some crossover from [u/Shandowarden](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shandowarden) 


What is Root? 

Root is a car insurance company, but also a data technology SaaS company.  Root requires drivers to download their mobile app that tracks driver behavior to inform the company how to rate your insurance. This is called telematics.  Before people start shitting on this company invading your privacy, hear me out. 
There are several states in the West that are proceeding with social injustice legislation to ban the usage of credit scoring within insurance rating.  See [OR](https://legiscan.com/OR/text/SB173/id/2236077) See [WA](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5010&Year=2021&Initiative=false) California already prohibits the use of credit scoring for auto policies.  

What does this mean? 

 Insurance companies rely on data to establish rates for all consumers.  If the state bans a specific rating factor (like credit score), the insurance companies will look to alternative data sources to increase granularity / provide competitive quotes for their consumers. ""Doesn't progressive already do this?"" Yes, the do; however, progressive is just one player in the game.  There are over 100 different insurance carriers in the West that write auto insurance, many of which are significantly smaller than the big boys.  In order to stay competitive, Root is going to serve as a necessary SaaS for the smaller insurance carriers to stay relevant / competitive.  

Alternatively, the bear scenario is that companies look to build this out themselves, which would lend Root to be a very attractive acquisition target. 

Root has very little debt: $209M

And lots of cash on hand: $1.1B in cash and cash equivalents, and $250M in cash / investments with its subsidiaries. This cash alone represents roughly 46% of the current ($2.8B) market cap. 

$LMND has a market cap of $6.3B (2/3rds of it's peak 3 months ago).  If $ROOT were to match that market cap of $6.3B (which arguably should be higher), we'd be looking around roughly $25 per share, let alone a short squeeze greater than GME... 

TLDR:  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀  ROOT is a tech based insurance company also selling SaaS via data and telematics.  Data is transforming the world, and the insurance industry is incredibly behind.  Data companies such as this one will be here to stay, if not acquired by other insurance companies.

3. Theaters in Los Angeles are set to reopen this Saturday (not necessarily AMC, but any news of theaters opening up is positive for AMC in this context).
4. AMC seems to have made a deal with WarnerMedia. CEO Adam Aron said their deal would likely reslut in lower fees they will have to pay to rent movies from the studio, thus increasing their gross margin.
5. B. Riley raised their Price Target for AMC to $7.00/share, up from $5.50.
6. Wedbush raise their PT to $6.50/share, up from $5.00.
7. ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" comes out this month. I personally will be seeing it in theaters and again buying tendies/soda/candy before the movie starts.
8. This subreddit 😎

I don’t do fundamental analysis. The only rule I have when investing is to buy companies that still have a visionary Founder or CEO who manages their business for growth instead of boomer metrics like quarterly earnings. $ABNB still has their founder at the helm and the guy is obviously a cold blooded killer. You don’t build a company like $ABNB otherwise. That said... If I were to do some kind of “analysis” I would say... 

1. $ABNB just crushed earnings.
2. They handled the pandemic extremely well, like as good as any company really could. They basically did everything right. Got a $1billion loan, cut cost (they even cut exec pay across the board) and at the same time protected customers. I’m sure you had an Airbnb booked when the pandemic hit and got a full refund... just think about how shitty your experience was with canceling your airline tickets. They also launched a fund to reimburse hosts for cancelled stays and opened a fund to help hosts pay mortgages. Point is they handled a major crisis extremely well, which goes back to my point about capable leaders managing for growth.
3. Travel is going to explode this summer. I know every single one of you has a wedding or some kind of event booked every weekend from July 2021 to Dec 2022. Where are you going to stay... Marriott?

This stock reminds me of $TSLA. $ABNB is positioned to be the single largest travel company in the world and actually provide a great service. They will start turning a profit within the next 12 months and the stock will make a major move up. Eventually it is going to get into the S&P and then 🚀🚀🚀🚀

FLWS,"# [ORIGINAL DD THREAD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnipvu/flws_the_rosebud_that_wsb_should_tickle/)

🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀

So it's been a rough past few weeks since I did this original DD. I added more shares to cost average down further during the rough ride last week. The stock railed  yesterday on some good news about new services related to birthdays. Next catalyst is earnings on April 26, 2021.

My convictions about the stock haven't changed. What has changed is the current short interest. As of 2/26 (according to nasdaq) the short count was \~ 6 million shares, with approximately  28 million  shares floating. At the current daily volume of \~1 million shares, it would take short positions approximately 6 days to cover. That's six days to really fucked up some hedgies. New data drops today at 5ish.

&#x200B;

I still believe in this stock, and imagine that the April earnings catalyst will put us in the high 30s/low 40s.

EXPE,"It has become apparent through recent events that the fate of Citadel and Melvin Capital are inextricably linked.  One might even say Melvin Capital is a thinly veiled shell company for Citadel to spread its holding positions and reduce risk of full exposure.  

In the event of a catastrophic market event (GME mother of all short squeezes for example), Citadel and Melvin will be forced to liquidate their most valuable long positions.  For Melvin Capital, this would start with Expedia, their largest portfolio holding by percent and totaling $1.5B in current market value.  

https://preview.redd.it/uxctj2oi2em61.png?width=563&format=png&auto=webp&s=378c368c44c2dc85abff6ba29ba59697ca6f3176

&#x200B;

Interestingly enough, Expedia is currently trading at all-time historical highs near $170/share, with a recent nasty pullback in January of this year to $120 range.  Expedia average daily volume is only \~3.5 million, and a share float of 113 million.  This means Melvin Capital's total EXPE long position is 10% of the entire EXPE public share float.

If Melvin Capital were to suddenly divest a portion of its Expedia holdings, the short term price of EXPE would capitulate downward, potentially triggering other institutional holders to also reduce their EXPE exposure.  

I have nothing against Expedia, but their recent share price run up combined with an institutional de-levering event as proposed above could make for a significant pullback.",The De-levering of Citadel and Melvin Capital via $EXPE,m2oxn9,42,100,0.91,100,0,,Discussion,False,True,1

Alright, fuck this shit. You get the gist already. I'm pretty sure you've read this quote for the millionth time by now. I don't want to waste your time here.

I've compiled a shit list of all the bad guys whom you Gee Em Mee apes need to watch out for. Along with their names I will post their misdeeds and links to sources as evidence. This is by no means a comprehensive list and I will continue to edit/update it as soon as my team of fellow Gee Em Mee enthusiasts and I dig up more dirt and uncover more information on these shitheads that deserve nothing but scorn (but no death threats, please!).

Let's get to it.

**Gabe Plotkin (CEO of Melvin Capital)**: If you don't know who this guy is, then you're a massive idiot. Have you been living under a rock all this time? I don't think you should be investing in a stock whose fundamentals you don't understand quite clearly.Quick recap: Melvin is the bastard with the short position on Gee Em Mee.

Anyways, Gabe pulled the race card and made the absurd claim in his hearing [testimony](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/testimony-of-gabriel-plotkin-founder-of-melvin-capital-management/8882e0d9-a683-4392-bc2e-87e56ba43baf/) that he received messages on Reddit like “it’s very clear we need a second holocaust, the jews can’t keep getting away with this.”

**But that was proven to be false**: WSB mod [/u/zjz](https://www.reddit.com/u/zjz/) debunked this claim in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm7z47/gabe_plotkin_claims_many_wsb_posts_were_laced/gntr31f?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) . Also Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit aka [/u/spez](https://www.reddit.com/u/spez/) also debunked it during the hearings.

On January 31st, Gabe's ex-wife, Yaara, filed for divorce, citing ""irreconciliable difference.""

Rumors are floating around that the divorce was done on purpose to protect his assets.

&#x200B;

On March 3rd, CNBC reported that Melvin posted a [return](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/melvin-capital-posts-return-of-more-than-20percent-in-february-sources-say.html) of 21.7% in February. Yeah right. Getting back to CNBC later...

**Ken Griffin** (CEO of Citadel): Melvin's master. This prick is the one that is receiving your order flow data if you trade with any of these 9 [brokers](https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/02/citadel-is-paying-for-order-flow-from-nine-online-brokerage-firms-not-just-robinhood/).

Wait what? You thought only Robinhood was colluding with this bastard? Well think again and open your eyes. Look at their [quants](https://youtu.be/2u007Msq1qo). Just look at them. Notice anything different? Look at their monitors for Chrissakes.  These geeks got first place in their Math Olympiad contests. They can't even speak ape, goddamn it.

Back on January 26th, the Day of the Squozening, Citadel and his butt buddy Point 72 bailed out Melvin with a 2.75 billion dollar [injection](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-ken-griffin-invest-3-billion-gamestop-short-seller-2021-1-1030003305). Have fun being their bitch and doing their bidding for life, Melvin. lulz

[u/420redditpornacct69](https://www.reddit.com/user/420redditpornacct69/) has more dirt on this bastard right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7o2rq/know_thy_enemy_kenneth_c_griffin_the_barbarian/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

**Steve Cohen** (CEO Point72): Fat fuck rescued Melvin as mentioned in the above entry. Also a white collar [criminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cohen_(businessman)). Deleted his Twitter account because he was too chickenshit to deal with the trolls.

**Jim Cramer**: host of Mad Money/coke head/former hedge fund manager. I'm pretty sure you've seen this infamous short-and-distort [video](https://youtu.be/r07Gg92YjOI) that was not meant to be leaked.

**CNBC**: shills whatever securities Melvin/Citadel and the rest of the shorts are holding. Silver/Es El Vee. Cee Cee Eye Vee/Lucid [(did you see that pump and dump on the 23rd of Feb? lmfao)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/811473329361518615/820083536433643550/chart.png) **(EDIT: That PnD happened exactly ONE DAY before GME spiked again on the 24th.  Coincidence?  Hmmm...)**. Rocket. Etc. etc. Talked shit about Reddit traders and [WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l54ky3/an_open_letter_to_cnbc/) for ages.

EDIT: [Along with MarketWatch, CNBC also reported the dip on GME early on March 10th.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m2n44x/webull_confirms_cnbc_article_about_gme_price_drop/)

**Leon Cooperman** (CEO of Omega Advisors): Another irrelevant old geezer and hedgie. Got busted for [insider trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Cooperman) back in 2016 and paid a hefty fine, but keeps denying any wrongdoing. Imbecile really has a habit of crying on live air like an baby. In this [video](https://youtu.be/mI-nItz56Fs) he warns the audience that the squeeze ""will not end well for the public"" and in this video right [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59xBSGe45gQ), he pleads with the media to ""not portray billionaires as criminals."" I can't make this shit up.

**Chamath Palihapitiya** (CEO of Social Capital): When he's not busy shilling his shitty SPACs and SoFi brokerage firm, this man child likes to post stupid shit on Twitter like "" Im about to really fuck some shit up...just fyi."" and douchy half-naked selfies with chicken legs.

Let's recap what this two-faced dumbass did:

1. [Bought $115 calls on GME on the 26th.](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354089928313823232?lang=en) Quickly cashed them out (paper hand snake), gave it to charity, and went onto CNBC to give himself a pat on the back and to ""defend"" Reddit investors and WSB. More like find support for his potential run for governor of California and his shitty SPACs, amirite? [Fuck shit up, lulz.](https://i.imgur.com/XKmCfQU.png)
2. Lambasted Robinhood for selling data to Citadel, when his SoFi brokerage firm does the exact same shit.According to Wikipedia: In early 2021, during the [GameStop short squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze), he repeatedly attacked [Robinhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinhood_(company)) and its founders for being unethical by selling payment for order flow to HFT firms like [Citadel Securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_LLC) and pushed his fans to switch over to [SoFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi), which was merging with his SPAC. [SoFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi) employs the same practice of selling payment for order flow to HFT firms (including to Citadel Securities) and owns a 16% stake in Apex Clearing Corp a clearing house involved in the controversy.[\[58\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamath_Palihapitiya#cite_note-58)[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamath_Palihapitiya#cite_note-59)[\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamath_Palihapitiya#cite_note-60)
3. Owns 16% stake in APEX. APEX is the clearing firm that prevented several brokers from allowing investors to purchase the meme stonks during the Squozening. More on that later...

**MarketWatch**: Hoo boy. This just happened today (March 10th, 2021), but man is the plot thickening or is the plot thickening? [At 11:55 AM EST, journalist Wallace Witkowski reported the dip on GME 25 FUCKING MINUTES before it began.](https://twitter.com/MrDavidNIO/status/1369733681259053061) Uh, SEC, you seeing this shit?

For the record, I believe the shorts pumped and dumped GME today to scare the paper hands into selling. It was still up 6% for the day. Oops.

PS,"Hi WSB,

I decided to check out palantir and this is what I like:

&#x200B;

1. 120 billion TAM
2. Impressive DEMO day showcasing Gotham and Foundry
3. Recent partnership with AWS 
4. great Q4 earnings and they projected the revenue will grow to 4 billion by 2025
5. they are basically in the big data business which i do not see much competition, nobody is close to what they are doing
6. stamp of approval by Cathie Wood with the given massive buying. PLTR has 1.16% weightage in their portfolio

I've taken matters into my own hands and made a simple valuation model. My goal is to get a feel for how big palantir will be in 2025 and their share price target. 

* Alex karp said projected revenue will be 4b by 2025, which is a 30% growth rate.
* I think they will confidently hit 45% compounded annual growth rate, giving them revenue of 7 billion.
* what im stuck now is applying a PS ratio. assuming PS of 20, the market cap would be 105 billion. 
* at the time of writing, PLTR market cap is 43b, so we are expecting a 2.4 x increase? i think its quite impressive but maybe a bit overhyped? maybe my valuation is totally wrong and too pessimistic.
* im still excited about PLTR but just doing my due diligence. I'm open for any criticism or feedback. 

&#x200B;

[a simple valuation i made](https://preview.redd.it/rvliundd7cm61.png?width=1623&format=png&auto=webp&s=1176eeeab29f026e2a4fdb8fa4c460c10c6319b3)

this is my first time doing a valuation model so let me know what yall think. I know its kinda pointless crunching numbers because it would be inevitably wrong anyway (if it were correct all the time, i would have been rich by now lol). but at least it gives me a starting point to work on.

TSLA,"Here’s an article about it:

https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-ge-is-doing-a-reverse-stock-split-and-what-it-means-for-you-11615391261

And here’s my take on it:

There is no innate reason why a stock split or reverse split would change the held value of a stock, it just changes share price and the amount of shares held/floated. That being said, last year we saw some big movement when popular companies (like TSLA for instance) did stock splits to reduce their share price. This had the effect of making these stocks more available to retail investors like us, which ended up causing prices to surge.

Now, could a reverse stock split work similarly? Well, no, because it’s putting shares further out of reach of the average retail investor. That being said, current share price of GE is around $14 so the new price would be around $112, which certainly isn’t ludicrously expensive. The thing that I’m most attracted to is the fact that this would have the effect of immediately cutting float by 87.5%.

Think about what’s happened with GME (similar ticker lulz). Basically we fucked the shorts by eating up all the float. When there’s not much float available, prices go up, and shorts get fucked and end up driving the price up further when they close out their positions. What I’m saying is if investors start buying up GE heavily up to the reverse split and/or even shortly after it, the float is going to get very limited, which could have the effect of pushing the price very high (supply and demand).

Anyway, I just like the stock. I’ve been playing it long for quite a while now and it’s been climbing very steadily over the past few months (new CEO seems to know his shit).

I was bored and curious as to how the dot com bubble popped so I looked into it and found this way too correlated to right now

>In February 2000, with the Year 2000 problem no longer a worry, Alan Greenspan announced plans to aggressively raise interest rates, which led to significant stock market volatility as analysts disagreed as to whether or not technology companies would be affected by higher borrowing costs.

So the fed hasnt came out and raised rates but mortgage companies are already raising rates and the broader repo market refusal to buy bonds are a bad sign. Smart money isnt dumb enough to buy inflation is only at 2.9% and it is showing in equities and real estate. Many analysts/fund managers have came out and said they expect repo rates to spike as high as 3% by the end of the year.


On tope of this even though its not rate hikes, they just fucking rekt any corporations paying execs over 1M and made sure to put into the stimmy 60B worth of tax hikes removing deductions for large corporations and the CNBC/Bloomberg channels havent said a fucking word even though this is kind of significant.

[Tax hikes snuck into stimulus bill](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/10/covid-relief-bill-tax-hikes-475051)

>On March 13, 2000, news that Japan had once again entered a recession triggered a global sell off that disproportionately affected technology stocks.

>On March 15, 2000, Yahoo! and eBay ended merger talks and the Nasdaq fell 2.6%, but the S&P 500 Index rose 2.4% as investors shifted from strong performing technology stocks to poor performing established stocks.

The Daq is current down 6% on the month and the S&p is close to flat. Another extremely odd similarity, I mean the time frames are almost the same too not that it really matters.

I mean what the absolute fuck. The writing is seems to be on the wall. Like this is so eerily similar to what happened in 2000. 

Add into this the absolute fearlessness retail has regarding “Stonks go up bro” is scary. We are like deer in those neighborhoods where people havent gone hunting in decades and we are eating out of the predators hands. Last march was essentially a flash crash. This is the longest bull run in history.

PRPL,"First of all- I am retiring from PRPL DD unless something Crazy Happens - The two videos posted below are what investors really needed to hear from PRPL CEO. I am more confident in the long term story than ever before and finally........ the company has come out and given us something to really listen to and to understand the 5 year narrative for purple's growth plan. There are no plays, just optimistic thoughts. 

I believe the recent price correction into the mid to high 30's is still in play in the short term and the 50 dollar price target is still in tact for end of year. This is just a guesstimate, I've been wrong more than I am right, but the upwards trajectory continues.

 A lot of you have been through the ups and down of PRPL with me. I wanted to give you my last DD before I focus on other investments. All of this DD is coming from two investor conferences that occurred in the last 48 hours. I am doing my best to summarize the key points.

# Key Takeaways: Links for videos are at Bottom if you want to watch.

**Just as a wakeup call for the idiots that say ""It's a mattress company."" This company is printing money.**

**in 2016 they did 65M in revenue- in 4 years their revenue is now 10X higher.**

# There is no stopping Purple's Domestic Plans 

***PURPE IS OPENING A STORE every \~12 DAYS for the rest of the year.***

* PRPL is anticipating becoming the #2 Player in the industry and is targeting \~1.5B\~2B in revenue- this Move is expected to take 3-5 years.
* PRPL is looking at tons of Merger and Acquisitions and this could potentially be a strategy but this is not their focus.
* PRPL anticipates 30-36% Growth for this year (2021) to 840-880M
   * PRPL Capacity at the end of 2021 will exceed 1B on a capacity standpoint
* PRPL is nearly doubling their brick and mortar presence in 2021 alone
   * 1500 stores
* PRPL anticipates 20-30% for the 2022+ years----- 3 to 5 years worth of continued growth domestically.
* PRPL anticipates Foreign Expansion won't be their focus until late 2022/2023
* PRPL is in 1800 stores and commands on 3% market share but they believe they will continue to take market share even in a downturn.
   * Tempur-Pedic is in about \~8000 stores.
* PRPL expects that they will have \~1.3B to \~1.5B before expanding internationally
* PRPL has tons of opportunity for higher price points in bedding
* PRPL believes 50% of the market opportunity is outside of the USA.
   * PRPL is so confident that they aren't focusing on overseas expansion until 2022 with the real effort anticipated to be in 2023
* Expansion is looking to be omni-channel
   * There is headroom for tons of Mattress firms
   * ""All Premium"" retailers have reached out to purple
* There is enough door expansion that they wouldn't be able to support them
   * PRPL is pacing expansion to ensure they can service their customers

ESTIMATING EBITDA for next 3 to 5 years- I am using 12.5% as midpoint Purple indicated it could be as high as 15% in 3-5 years.

# THE REASON FOR THE DROP AFTER EARNINGS

* Purple indicated the miss was not due to competition it was due to soft guidance for Q1 as a momentum quarter
* Soft guidance for Q1 is due to the quarter being focused on getting ready for Q2 onward
* Q3 will witness most of the growth that bleeds into Q4
* There are supply constraints that have pushed some of the growth out- they are working through this.
   * The only constraint affecting purple is coils.
   * They are hand to mouth on coils and will need more coils
   * Purple is not worried about competition at this point as they are no where near close to saturation.

# Where could the Stock Price GO

I have provided 2 P/E ratios and I have used the 25% growth scenario to calculate EBITDA. Based on these numbers, we could see a price from 30-96. If they exceed this then it wouldn't be unrealistic to see 45-120 as the range in the next 5 years. 2021 is a little over estimated as compared to their guidance.

&#x200B;

[My rough estimates assuming EBITDA multiples of 20 and 25 and EBITDA Margin of 12.5&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/0ee72023rbm61.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce469b42deaefe1744a9d51be7df53e2d8abaf7a)

# Comparing to Tempur Sealy using a higher EV/Sales ratio

Tempur sealy has about 1.5B in debt ,so their Enterprise value is much higher than purple. Using EV/Sales as an indicator for PRPL, we could assume that 3x Ev/Sales due to PRPLS superior growth and it would put the stock price @ 37.00 based on 2021 revenue estimates, 46.00 based on 2022 estimates, 57.00 based on 2023 estimates, 72 based on 2024 estimates and 90 based on 2025 estimates.

&#x200B;

The Chart below is TPX (Tempur Sealy's current Metrics). Purple is growing much quicker and will likely command significantly better multiples.

&#x200B;

# The analyst we need to follow- This guy is a savant and he covers tons of big names and is the 3rd most accurate analyst out of more than 7,000.

I am going to talk briefly about Brian Nagel because a lot of people don't understand how significant his coverage is. Of the Tip ranks analysts, he is ranked #3.

* Carvana is a stock that Brian has been coving since it was in the 30's...... The stock is nearly 260 dollars.
* Brian's average buy recommendation returns almost 40%. Brian has PRPL at a strong buy

The song for today's post is **Burial and Four Tet - Moth (Forest Swords Remix).** Put it On.

**This post is not financial advice**. **I am not a financial advisor.**  I... I'll be honest, I am just a dude sitting here at his desk trying to figure this shit out. I feel like that I'm staring into this abyss full of monsters who promise me money but require my sanity in exchange. This market.... This fucking market.  Every single fucking cent of that stimulus will go straight into Robinbull or WeHood and make this crack smoking Market start huffing paint thinner as well. Welcome to the future. It looks like a 3rd world roller coaster and it's severe pimping of physics.  People are going to die having ""fun"".

If I am wrong about something call me out... I can take it.

# The Teslabro Fears the CanooTruck

I never imagined that I would spend so much time shilling for something that looks like it was designed in a Sanfransiscan Bath House but [today's leak](https://www.reddit.com/r/canoo/comments/m208cq/canoo_pickup_truck_leak_pics_and_specs_inside/) of Canoo Truck really pushed me into the zone of CanooBro fanboy.  This Lesbian Mystery Machine is so financially compelling that I am straight ""Jacked to the Tits"", as /u/effinwookie puts it, in GOEV calls.

**My current positions.**

1. 46 4/16 15$c - Original Sane Position
2. 20 3/19 17.5$c - Straight Gambling
3. 40 4/16 30$c - Retarded Yolo Gambling  Inspired by CavemanTurboChad /u/knyggaplease

I might be Blue collar fancy on the dab but I'm not as ""Jacked"" to the **Moontits** as the rest of the fucking market. There is a total of [98,725](https://u.teknik.io/nbcFT.PNG) open interest for March 19th Calls.... 9.8 Million Shares most of them out of the money.  Think about that...

I didn't even look at the puts... ^((Ok TBH after writing that  I just looked at the puts because I don't want to be wrong) )

Lets talk about today's trading and what Ortex tells us about short interest. Today we saw a gap opening which settled down into slow bullish trajectory that dipped into close. As I write this at 1900 3/10 I am going to predict that short interest grew as today (ortex lags a day in estimating short interest) trading was characterized by a price capping style where there always seemed to be a few hundred shares that appear out of no where.  This is encouraging and discouraging at the same time.

**Future Self finds** \-  Ortex [money shot](https://u.teknik.io/BvM6k.png)\- 3/11/201 - **Oh this is good!**

* **DTC Increased to 1.46**
* **Estimated SI Increased to 10.1 Mil!**
* **Utilization is 100**

edit - 3  (SI increasing with Price is confirmatory of my thesis there was significant price capping yesterday but they were unable to actually bring the price down.  The DTC increase is the most significant and we are looking like we are going to a gap open this morning)

I am highly encouraged that some shorts have covered yet others (or the same one) have/has opened new positions at a lower share price. Average age of shorting has increased over the past few days but this could just be that the new short positions ""weigh"" less than the older ones.  This digging in of the heels shows the power of the gamma ramp magnetism.

[GoevWhale Twitter](https://twitter.com/GoevWhale) found this Dark pool Order by [Dark Pool Melstone](https://twitter.com/MelStone31/status/1369353690566524934?s=20)

(Dark pools allow massive transactions of shares to occur without affecting the share price)

I consulted the **Godfather (AKA Cartesian Ghost AKA Hal Squarerootofnegative1)** about the fact that 2 Days ago someone purchased 5000 4/16 25$p  which this dark pool order perfectly matches. Someone is probably taking up a synthetic short position to hedge their bets against the share price increasing.  As the share price goes psycho the IV spikes so do the prices of Puts.     This is big time shit.. Retail is just along for the ride.   The Godfather advises that this is to essentially retain the freedom to maneuver and stay net neutral to ride the SP.  This is a bet that the SP will skyrocket in March and dip in April and then Continue to move up... Or April gave them the best vantage point to play the field... its probably /u/deepfuckingvalue

What is encouraging is that the pattern over the last few days has been gap openings met with  price capping and bullish long pressure to stabilize and push it.  (I actually think that monday we saw a recent short cover as we ran around the mountain and AVG age of shorts increased) We can see from the above chart what gap openings do to the price.  (A: MM have to buy more shares.)  Check the last few days we have seen an immediate spike in price on open with it settling down and then slowly rising as a long continues to push shorts, its actually straight warfare if you watch the L2 (and of course normal profit taking, day trading or retail or whatever its not all about short squeezing is it now).

**This makes me believe that Shorts are opening new positions lower but aren't willing to go hard in the paint...**  They are essentially just digging their heels in as they are being slowly shoved towards a cliff..

SI increasing slightly with SP increasing is confirmatory of this thesis.  I'll update in the morning

**Listen, What I am saying is that Someone or some people with 9 milly in Short Interest spent the last few months beating your stock like a rented mule and then went and spent that margin somewhere else thinking $GOEV was SPAC trash.  They woke up monday morning hung over from their month long Put party in a real bad situation and are now fighting like a cat over a fucking toilet to save themselves but you showed up with leather gloves on and a Surprise fucking truck and let the Gimp out of the cage... Didn't you... Fuck Yeah CanooBro... Fuck yeah. Velma Gonna Holla at ya'**

But for real Chairman of the Board ain't no fool.  I suggest you look him up.

# This truck upsets the TeslaBro.

This ""Truck"" Leaked today (thank you /u/PlaneReflection)   After looking at this truck for one second I could only get so erect. This ""Truck"" was obviously designed by someone who has never seen a truck before because they were too busy playing fortnight. This is ok because there's genius here.

**The highlights for me are**

1. You can fit a sheet of plywood in the back.
2. It has an extended cab
3. You can power tools off of it.
4. It is meant to bring Flyoverstate people into the EV world.
5. The subscription allows small businesses to scale fleet size.  This is unknown to people that live in LA and think people sanely work on roofs in the winter in the midwest or east coast.

(Cybertruck will release with the same level of reception as CyberPunk... Sick Burn Bro.)

**The money story,** and whats great about /u/planereflections drop, is that [Reuters wrote an article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-canoo-evs-pickup/ev-startup-canoo-plans-to-roll-out-american-built-pod-like-electric-pickup-in-2023-idUSKBN2B3010?il=0) about the truck leak.  (**I can't confirm this directly but reports from the front state the article originally just said truck leak yadda yadda cool story bro.)**  Then they went to go talk to the Chairman (Who cares about the CEO these days) who didn't answer them until the market closed and said, yeah **GigaChad Tesla Killer** will be made in a microfactory...  Oh by the way We're looking for states to put the factory in (IE Texas, perhaps texas and maybe... Texas). Oh Preorders Q2 2021. This news was updated 10 minutes before market closed.  Last transaction was 889 Shares at 13.40.  12k on that price.   This news isn't priced in....

**Look, What I am trying to say is that these shorts are 9 million Shares in at around a sp of 17 or 18... This shit starts getting more squeezy and as it nears those numbers aided by a sick gamma ramp somewhere around 24$ SP margins start getting called. Also Earnings hasn't even dropped yet...**

GOOD,"GOOD EVENING to all of my favorite little Crayon eating, piss martini drinking, diamond handed big NUTTED ape buddies,

Now I know that all of you little shit throwing apes that haven't been on this ride before were dropping fat donkey kongs in your Huggies this afternoon during the brief GME/AMC nosebleed. If you survived the slaughter, congratu-fucking-lations. If you bought the dip, you know the way, and are truly, one big fat diamond loving retard. If you paper handed or had stop-losses set, you're a bitch and the rest of us diamond hands thank you for exiting our rocket before we make our first landing on planet **$69,420.69**. The Tendieman is coming way faster than you think.

**The Hedgefunds**

Today, these stupid little shit fuckers really decided to show us their entire hand. They used the same short attack that they used previously, but not only did they do it so blatantly obvious, they did it across our beloved GME and AMC (THESE ARE THE ONLY PLAYS THAT MATTER, THEY DID IT ELSEWHERE TOO). This was the most obvious share-shake attempt that I've ever seen, and it was done more outwardly than the previous attempt. **THEY'RE SCARED, WE HAVE TO BE CLOSE TO INITIATING PHASE 1 OF THE MOASS.** As GME and AMC keep rising, they have to keep buying more and more shares to lose less money on the options that are ITM or will be ITM by the end of the week. They extra fucked themselves today with their bullshit attack. **They triggered the short sale restriction** meaning that tomorrow (for GME), they won't be able to orchestrate such a massive attack because they'll only be able to short shares during upticks; *but ape say ""if big back fat crying down his back Melvin just short on uptick won't it crash?""* **NO, BECAUSE GME UPTICKS EVERY .6969696996420 MILLISECONDS.** ***Tomorrow we will be able to BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY*** and these chicken shits won't be able to shake the shares out of the paper handed bitches as easily as they had today. I'd include pretty little pictures with colors for all of you crayon eating shits, but I know they mean nothing to any of us, **HODL.**

**The Media**

The media is so fucking crooked and tied in with these hedgies that they literally only speak when GME and AMC downticks 10-20%. All day long they were silent until the short attack, then all of the sudden our ""MEME STOCKS"" were worthy of mentioning. I think this is clear indication that they're being paid and gagged by these chode dicked chicken shit hedgies. In conclusion, don't listen to the media, don't listen to the articles, the analysts, or even your mother. **TRUST THE RETARD INSIDE YOUR HEAD.**

**The Crayon Eaters**

Foremost, I love you ape brothers. Many of you have been here from the start, and some of you may have even just joined today, but it doesn't matter so long as you HODL. **Together ape strong.** Remember that you are holding diamonds, everyday that you hold these diamonds you're costing Wallstreet and the egotistical bastards that stole from your families in 2008 billions and billions of dollars, but its nothing in comparison to what we will achieve when we take back *TENS of billions* of dollars from them. Getting rich is cool, but sticking it to the man and getting back what is rightfully ours is even sweeter. I've gained a sense of true happiness from these gorgeous little stonks, and I've already decided that IF these stocks go to zer-**HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHA FUCK THAT THESE BITCHES AINT GOIN' NOWHERE THEY'RE GOING TO THE GO FUCKING PARABOLIC AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET FILTHY RICH; THE RED PRICE NEXT TO YOUR SHARES IS THE DISCOUNT TO BUY MORE. HANG IN THERE, NO RETARDS LEFT BEHIND. WE ARE COMING BACK FOR YOU ALL ON THE WAY TO $69,420,696,696,696,420.696.**

**TL;DR**

Fuck the hedgefunds, their bitchass tricks didn't work today, it made things worse, and made us apes stronger. The media is as F.O.S as they've ever been and are doing anything they can to help their hedgefund sugar daddies out. **Apes together strong, HODL till $69,420,696,696,696,420.696.**

***Obligatory legal pardon:*** **Don't listen to me I never passed 3rd grade, I am not a cat, but I am a thoroughly convinced diamond handed ape who loves the stonk. Plainly, I am not a financial advisor.**

NEXT,"GOOD EVENING to all of my favorite little Crayon eating, piss martini drinking, diamond handed big NUTTED ape buddies,

Now I know that all of you little shit throwing apes that haven't been on this ride before were dropping fat donkey kongs in your Huggies this afternoon during the brief GME/AMC nosebleed. If you survived the slaughter, congratu-fucking-lations. If you bought the dip, you know the way, and are truly, one big fat diamond loving retard. If you paper handed or had stop-losses set, you're a bitch and the rest of us diamond hands thank you for exiting our rocket before we make our first landing on planet **$69,420.69**. The Tendieman is coming way faster than you think.

**The Hedgefunds**

Today, these stupid little shit fuckers really decided to show us their entire hand. They used the same short attack that they used previously, but not only did they do it so blatantly obvious, they did it across our beloved GME and AMC (THESE ARE THE ONLY PLAYS THAT MATTER, THEY DID IT ELSEWHERE TOO). This was the most obvious share-shake attempt that I've ever seen, and it was done more outwardly than the previous attempt. **THEY'RE SCARED, WE HAVE TO BE CLOSE TO INITIATING PHASE 1 OF THE MOASS.** As GME and AMC keep rising, they have to keep buying more and more shares to lose less money on the options that are ITM or will be ITM by the end of the week. They extra fucked themselves today with their bullshit attack. **They triggered the short sale restriction** meaning that tomorrow (for GME), they won't be able to orchestrate such a massive attack because they'll only be able to short shares during upticks; *but ape say ""if big back fat crying down his back Melvin just short on uptick won't it crash?""* **NO, BECAUSE GME UPTICKS EVERY .6969696996420 MILLISECONDS.** ***Tomorrow we will be able to BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY*** and these chicken shits won't be able to shake the shares out of the paper handed bitches as easily as they had today. I'd include pretty little pictures with colors for all of you crayon eating shits, but I know they mean nothing to any of us, **HODL.**

**The Media**

The media is so fucking crooked and tied in with these hedgies that they literally only speak when GME and AMC downticks 10-20%. All day long they were silent until the short attack, then all of the sudden our ""MEME STOCKS"" were worthy of mentioning. I think this is clear indication that they're being paid and gagged by these chode dicked chicken shit hedgies. In conclusion, don't listen to the media, don't listen to the articles, the analysts, or even your mother. **TRUST THE RETARD INSIDE YOUR HEAD.**

**The Crayon Eaters**

Foremost, I love you ape brothers. Many of you have been here from the start, and some of you may have even just joined today, but it doesn't matter so long as you HODL. **Together ape strong.** Remember that you are holding diamonds, everyday that you hold these diamonds you're costing Wallstreet and the egotistical bastards that stole from your families in 2008 billions and billions of dollars, but its nothing in comparison to what we will achieve when we take back *TENS of billions* of dollars from them. Getting rich is cool, but sticking it to the man and getting back what is rightfully ours is even sweeter. I've gained a sense of true happiness from these gorgeous little stonks, and I've already decided that IF these stocks go to zer-**HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHA FUCK THAT THESE BITCHES AINT GOIN' NOWHERE THEY'RE GOING TO THE GO FUCKING PARABOLIC AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET FILTHY RICH; THE RED PRICE NEXT TO YOUR SHARES IS THE DISCOUNT TO BUY MORE. HANG IN THERE, NO RETARDS LEFT BEHIND. WE ARE COMING BACK FOR YOU ALL ON THE WAY TO $69,420,696,696,696,420.696.**

**TL;DR**

Fuck the hedgefunds, their bitchass tricks didn't work today, it made things worse, and made us apes stronger. The media is as F.O.S as they've ever been and are doing anything they can to help their hedgefund sugar daddies out. **Apes together strong, HODL till $69,420,696,696,696,420.696.**

***Obligatory legal pardon:*** **Don't listen to me I never passed 3rd grade, I am not a cat, but I am a thoroughly convinced diamond handed ape who loves the stonk. Plainly, I am not a financial advisor.**

&#x200B;

edit 1 :

PS,"TLDR: Fedex earnings is approaching March 18th, stock is down over 10% from its last ER when it reported its best quarter ever. This quarter will blowout expectations, the stock has completely flown under the radar on low volume, options are dirt cheap and average price target is $327 representing over 25% upside, 500%+ for March options assuming the price moves back to where it was right before last earnings. Positions at the bottom.

EDIT: One day after my post Goldman Sachs upgrades FDX to $356 price target with buy rating [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FDX/?RegistrationCode=SocialMedia-direct&utm\_source=GeneralSocialMedia&utm\_medium=Social&utm\_campaign=SocialMedia](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FDX/?RegistrationCode=SocialMedia-direct&utm_source=GeneralSocialMedia&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=SocialMedia)

Below are bulletpoints for DD on FDX, delivering you massive tendies going into their ER next week. My last DD was buying puts on $snow that was trading near $400 and now $230 today, resulting in 200%+ put profits ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow\_massive\_dilution\_incoming\_easy\_put/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow_massive_dilution_incoming_easy_put/)).

* Fedex reports earnings next Thursday, this quarter includes:
   * Record Black Friday shipping
   * Record Cyber Monday shipping
   * Vaccine shipping and just inked deal to deliver J&J vaccine
   * Record Holiday season shipping
      * This was extended from normally  Jan 1st to Jan 19th, almost 3 more weeks of extended excessive shipping
   * Huge 5% surcharge on all packages that started on January 4th that will be permanent, this will help offset increased costs ([https://www.freightwaves.com/news/most-recent-fedex-pricing-surcharges-feel-permanent](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/most-recent-fedex-pricing-surcharges-feel-permanent))
      * Many retailers complaining during earnings that they saw a significant uptick in shipping costs
   * Increased global footprint and TNT efficiency gains with workforce reduction, FDX should be handling most global vaccine deliveries too
   * Inked a massive deal with Walmart to handle their returns, this bodes well for future revenue steams ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-unveils-returns-called-151303675.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-unveils-returns-called-151303675.html))
* FDX is INSANELY CHEAP. Forward P/E of 13.79, that is roughly HALF of the SP500 with a very low P/S of .9 and attractive PEG of .99
* Yes it is a bit of a boomer stock, the benefit is that there is low volume that is keeping options cheap and stock price low. A blowout earnings should move the stock up very quickly like we saw in q2 and q3 last year.
* Current stock price target is $326 representing over 25% upside in the stock and easily 200%+ for options depending on expiration and strike.

* The above sets up Fedex for a MASSIVE beat on earnings next week and analyst estimates are VERY low. On the last ER call, the CEO noted it was their best quarter ever, first time surpassing $20B and this upcoming quarter will be even better.
   * Here is the kicker, with this massive amount of good news I just mentioned, the stock has gone DOWN over 13% since the last ER.
   * More so, the average Q3 estimate was $4.01 and FDX beat at an incredible $4.83 with massive surprise. Q4 average estimate is lowered by almost 20% to $3.33 when this is expected to be their best quarter ever. This lowered analyst estimate is due to expectation of costs rising but the amount of added revenue should offset the cost which means the earnings surprise this quarter should be even bigger
      * Why did FDX sell off since last blowout ER? This was because they offered no guidance and the market punished FDX unnecessarily for it.

* Ecommerce shipping volume is up significantly, isn't stopping anytime soon and many analysts underestimate the double-ship benefit FDX gets from online retailers standardizing free return shipping.
* I suspect this will run up into earnings next week, March 19th $270 are only $6, that represents a bit more than a 5% move from now to after earnings. This should run to that right before ER if not more, then if ER is a blowout you should see the stock gap back up to $300 where it was in Q4. If so, that would be almost a 500% profit. My positions are below, I gave it a bit more time to play out.
* Positions june 300c and 320c

Aight you retards. This some serious shit we gonna go through. Strap in because the so called, ""2nd squeeze"" will be big, even though it isn't the squeeze we all know will eventually happen that will fk over HFs and allow us to finally land on Mars with Elon's rocket ship.

Alright, so looking at the chart for GME over the last 3 months, we can see there is a large spike after the initial run up, highlighted by the small white box before the large blue box. From corner to corner (closing prices for those days) is what I believe is the ""run up"" before the ""squeeze"" (just a metaphor). **This area goes from $19.95 to $43.03, or an increase of about 216% (x2.16).**

**Now, when looking at the blue box that follows, we can see that from corner to corner we have a price** **range of $43.03 to $347.51, or an increase of 808% (x8.08).** Now, when comparing the increases on both days, we can see that the 216% ""run up"" over a period of 7 trading days led an 808% gain, or a x3.74 increase. This means that for each day that passes within the ""run up"" is an increase in the multiplying factor by 0.534, resulting in our 808% increase for the apparent ""squeeze"".

*Just to double check, with that x2.16 increase of the run up, we can apply this and multiply by 3.74 (0.534 \* 7 days). This leads to the 808% increase that we calculated above.*

So, assuming that this x0.534 factor stays true, let's apply this to the recent ""run up"" we had starting 13 trading days ago.

Over this period of 13 trading days for the current ""run up"", **we have a range of $44.97 to $262.99, or a 585% increase (x5.85).**

Applying the ""run up"" factor of 0.534, **13 trading days \* 0.534 = 6.942 --> 6.942 \* 5.85 = 40.61.**

40.61 \* the closing price of today ($262.99) = A closing price of the height of the ""2nd squeeze"" of $10,680.02, or an increase of 4061%.

**TL;DR: We will have an increase of about 4000% during the apparent ""2nd squeeze"" to have a share price of $10,680.02. Hold the fking line.**

Edit: Yes, I have no fking idea what I'm doing.","The 2nd ""Squeeze"" will be big - GME TA",m2bzc8,56,311,0.91,311,0,,Technical Analysis,False,True,-1

PT,"Originally, I submitted this as a comment from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m250bb/the_hedges_are_currently_working_with_the_news_to/) but it was getting buried in the noise so I made a post instead.

If you go to search for the article that is posted in the screenshot of MrDavidNIO's tweet ([Exhib A](https://mobile.twitter.com/MrDavidNIO/status/1369733681259053061), [Exhib B](https://mobile.twitter.com/MrDavidNIO/status/1369769100830904320)), you'll see that there is no such MarketWatch article under that exact title. However, on the RH app, if you scroll down to the News section of GME, it still lists the MarketWatch article with the **original** title, ""GameStop stock was reaching new heights, but the meme stock just plummeted"". If you open the article, you will see that it is the new article with the revised title, ""[The meme-stock roller coaster just reached new heights of volatility](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-was-reaching-new-heights-but-shares-in-the-meme-stocks-just-plummeted-11615398208)"", which still has the full **original** title in the **URL**.

It's difficult to make causality statements with the limited facts, but I feel that they point to the possibility that this was pre-written with knowledge of what was coordinated to happen.

I'd advise buyers of Credit Acceptance Corporation to understand the regulatory and punitive risk associated with their Civil Action Lawsuit. The potential costs of these issues could be huge, much larger than what's being considered currently. Damages can be treble (triple) for various predatoy lending violations not to mention possible violations to interstate commerce.

They did receive financing recently. I have no information what their collateral is but if it's cars- that's a depreciating asset in a changing market segment. When I look at their technical trends, I wonder what changed in 2015 / 2016 / 2017 when the slope of growth changed. PEST analysis can give you a few clues. Institutional Ownership has decreased approx 4.75% over the last 3 months and I suspect this trend will continue considering PE and Book Value Per Share.

IQ,"**TL;DR**

IQ is undervalued and technically promising. It has a cocktail of factors similar to TSLA 4 months ago before the 1000% rise. If it breaks out of its current trading range, it can soar very high.

**Fundamentals**

iQIYI is currently the #1 video streaming site in China. Truly the 'Netflix of China', it has more users than any other platform. Competition is intense - Tencent and Alibaba have competitor platforms - but iqiyi is still number 1, and that gives them the opportunity to grow their lead.

IQ is a growth stock, currently being valued as if it isn't. It's heavily in debt - as you'd hope all growth stocks would be - and it continues to invest in producing original content, at the expense of more tangible assets. They don't seem to care about profit, and have very rough financials. This is typical for growth stocks with a high valuation - the valuation is usually based on speculation about the future. However, IQ has a low valuation. Speculation about the future is *not priced in*. Its market cap is just $22b. It is currently being viewed like a struggling company - which it isn't. This means it is highly susceptible to a huge change in valuation, just by viewing it as a growth stock and pricing in the value of the huge array of exclusive content, and more users than any other platform. This current valuation is insane.

IQ is also being shorted, based on some very, very, uninformed claims ('[faking their numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/08/iqiyi-accused-of-fraud-by-wolfpack-muddy-waters.html)' - a company surveyed people in China and basically didn't find as many using Iqiyi as their numbers would suggest. A completely unreliable unscientific study that used a tiny sample size (1500) and drew sweeping conclusions, aided by a single ex-employee, and some unspecified *'data'*, this is garbage, probably produced for self-promotion purposes among the Sinophobic investment crowd. This study launched an SEC investigation, which heavily suppressed the stock price, but the whole thing is simply ridiculous). Regardless, shorts get squeezed when the price goes up, whether they're right or wrong.

**TECHNICALS**

*IQ has been in a trading range for 2 years

*It has just closed at the very top of that range.

*Momentum has been VERY strong approaching this level - rising almost every day, even when related stocks/indicies fell.

If it breaks out of the range, it will soar - due to: 

1. The technicals (the end of the trading range leading to a breakout)
2. The short squeeze
3. That price rise causing reevaluation as a growth stock and pricing in the intangible assets.
4. Then, renewed interest and maybe even the hype it deserves.

**SUMMARY**

This is a growth stock being wrongfully viewed as a struggling company, beset by shorts and in a trading range for 2 years. This is *essentially the exact same scenario that Tesla ($TSLA) was in 4 months ago*, before its 1000% rise. If it breaks out, it can go very high.

If it doesn't break out, it will likely go down to the $15-$17 area at the bottom of the range.

AAL,"AAL issued a massive amount of debt today, roughly $10 billion to repurchase debt that was paying 11.5% by issuing debt that yields only 5.5%.

Sounds fucking awesome right.  

The issuance was oversubscribed by $35 Billion no less.

But while that is nice and all, the devil is in the details.

The company still burns 30 million dollars a day paying people to do work that isn’t making the company money.

The leveraged away their customer loyalty programs to secure the deal.  Meaning while the massive debt they just paid away looks great, the point being is that their company will see less in profits for the entire time the debt stays on the books.

Travel may be in a slight upswing, but here is food for thought, what if kids and teachers are working over the summer to get caught up in academics and people travel much less than anticipated?  That’s a realistic situation facing this country because otherwise an entire generation of children is being left behind.

Also I’m not convinced people are going to jump out and travel, I think a lot of people will be reluctant to and start by seeing friends and relatives locally before actually taking on more adventurous steps.

Business travel, the most lucrative kind of travel, has basically be scrapped by all major corporations unless it’s completely necessary.

There still aren’t going to be conferences where professionals travel to this year.  It isn’t going to happen.  

This is a classic buy the rumor, sell the news event because the stock itself has issued more shares in the last year to dilute and already terrible and diluted earnings.

You can hope to see a recovery, but until that day actually comes, this stock has the ability to really fuck people that are long on hope.

With the stimulus bill signed today, there isn’t much good news left in the market to be priced in.

Oil prices are on a steady increase towards $100 a barrel, and the airline industry which was horribly strapped for cash and could not estimate fuel demand last year underhedged their exposure.  Even if travel comes back, I hate to break it to you, it won’t be the airline companies making money, it’s going to be the oil industry.

JAN," 🍌? Yes.

Financial advice? No.

So this looks exactly like January. We tanked, then got back up, it might very well be that we'll see the markets close around the 260 mark today.

In January, the markets opened the next day, the price shot back up, the scared ""HODL""ers sold to ensure some modest gains, the price tanked again. If that hadn't happened, we'd be past Saturn now.

&#x200B;

Here is my elegant conclusion:

&#x200B;

You apes might be thinking of selling, now, but I encourage you to HODL through tomorrow's spike (do you like the stock or what?). We haven't had enough WS tears yet.

I expect that today happened because many bought in at 340 and cared about nothing else than to break even and to leave at least at 0. 🧻

We got rid of the cowards. HODL to the moon now.

WOOD,"In the latest statement of its finances presented prior to going public, Roblox has shown massive growth through 2020. It reported $924 million in revenue representing a year-on-year growth of 82%, as well as 32.6 million daily active users for a year-on-year growth of 85%.

Roblox was one company that benefited from 2020's lockdowns and social distancing measures, with social events held on its platform including concerts from Billie Eilish, Lizzo, and even the debut of a Lil Nas X single to 30 million viewers.

Roblox is trading under RBLX, with its direct listing to offer shares in the company to the public from March 10. It opened at $64.5 when it was estimated $45

My ape nephew spent $200 on robux like it was nothing. Literally every kid I know plays the game. Massive money maker in my opinion.

KOSS,"Hello WSB, this is my first official post, but I'm very proud to see how we have all HODL together really strong.

I have been in GME since 30 Oct 2019 with an additional 1670 shares on 29 May 2020 and I wish I could take a screenshot to prove my words, but my custodian account does not allow any screenshots out of ""security"" reasons. I currently hold over 6 digits of value in GME and I hope to reach my 7 digits and possibly 8. After what happened today, my 7 digits is certain, 8 digits possible. With more crayons maybe I'll reach 9.

That being said I like to share and encourage with everyone why this nosedive drop we seen today is actually the BEST affirmation we really need.

There's been wonderful DD that the Short interest are still extremely high and that the data in FINRA is entirely unreliable. Let's be honest, before what happened today, no matter how certain we are, we weren't 100% sure.

I'm an expert in Chinese history, and I'll quote Sun Tzu, the famed author recognised for writing the Art of War over 2000 years ago.

“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”

Truth is we never really knew what the hedges were up to and this week was really fishy, with the absence of obvious short ladders and peaceful markets. Other than occasional dips everyday after reaching a peak, we couldn't tell much. Some people have speculated that maybe the hedges were buying calls in order to reduce their risks, but I think we can all agree now that there is a good possibility that the dips we've been seeing the last few days are just a test for hedges to see how much the price can be affected.

And let's be honest with ourselves, that was a coordinated attack. I have no idea how long they have planned that, but looking from what we've seen, it's definitely a lot of time. At that scale it's not possible for 1 or 2 hedge funds to pull this off by themselves. And YET!! This is where we recovered strong.

So what this means is this. The hedges are panicking. They are worried. And they have proven that the shorts *HAVE NOT BEEN COVERED*. If they have been covered to the large extent they claimed to, today's coordinated attack wouldn't have happened.

Not just did they admit with their actions that they are fearing us, they also basically highlighted to us what stocks they are all massively shorting. AMC, KOSS, NOK, BB all are in this together with us GME Army! 

You know it's like Harry Potter, where Voldemort basically handed the weapons to Harry by his own hands.

Based on Chinese History, there's this clever strategist Sun Tzu. For him before he executes any clever maneuvers for war, he will always test them first. If the hedges we are up against are the same smooth brain people like Sun Tzu, this fall is only a test. But it's costly to them and we have held strong. With the current prices, supposing they did buy some shares to cover their losses, all those buys from 180 to 250 are all gone. Now they are forced to buy shares above 260 and its only going to cost them even more. Much better for us.

Fellow apes, they are really afraid of our gamma squeeze this week and next week.

Now... We strike back, by doing NOTHING!

Edit:
[to the skeptics who need proof for everything](https://imgur.com/a/aTaF8j6)

I obviously have better things than to post everything on social media like a attention seeking person. I'm a retarded ape not a peacock. Your tongues will wag too no matter what even if my picture has shown my platform to be ancient. But that's nothing to do with my investing preferences. 

For you skeptics who need proof for everything and choose to always doubt and flake, here it is. ""A confident man does not live for the applause and approval of the non-worthy"". Your skeptical outlook has only said to me that you clearly did not see Gamestop for what it really was earlier on, and even if DFV's DD was shown to you in those days, you were a late adopter. It has also shown me that you have the paper hands tendency when you don't see potential and when the going gets tough. 

I thought I have surpassed and ignored most silly comments, but thanks to the 1% of negative words, you have helped me see I still react to silly nonsense and it's something I need to change in myself. You are a Hyena and this is a community of apes. Reflect on yourselves.",Why I'm super happy to watch evil hedgies shave 1/3 of GME and AMC,m25szi,402,5335,0.96,5335,0,,Discussion,False,True,1

OPK,"“$200 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be general senior unsecured obligations of the Company, will pay interest semiannually in arrears at a rate of 4.50% per annum” The conversion price of these bonds is $4.22 which is a discount of the current stock price. The number of shares that these bonds would be converted to is a little over 470,000 shares. This also states that convertible bond holders are receiving 4.5% interest annually which is a healthy number when considering other bond offerings. As a result of the healthy interest, it would be assumed the bond holders would not elect to convert and instead choose to receive the healthy interest year over year.

“The Notes will be convertible into, at the Company’s election, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and common stock” This gives OPKO Health the opportunity to use the profits generated from the unforeseen pandemic revenue and pay off the bonds in cash. This would lower shares outstanding and help minimize dilution.

“The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to February 15, 2022, but may redeem the Notes, at its option, on or after February 15, 2022 if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price for the Notes for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period.” This states that OPKO Health can close out these convertible bonds anytime after 2/15/2022 if the stock price is above $5.48 for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days.

So now that the facts of the convertible bonds are laid out, I want to share my thesis off of my DD. This is one idiot’s opinion and should not be taken as advice. These convertible bonds act as insurance for anyone that holds them. The convertible bond holders are able to open massive short positions to hedge against $OPK defaulting on their loan. If $OPK defaulted, their stock price would plummet, and the bond holders would lose out on their principal they paid for the bonds but they would make a much larger amount of money on their short positions. If the opposite happens and $OPK reaches full potential and the stock price rises gradually, the bond holders will slowly cover their short positions and will simply cash in on their convertible shares or the cash, whatever $OPK elects to give. So we have big money players with hand in both the short and long positions and they don’t care which way the stock price goes because they will make a lot of money either way.
The catch here is that $OPK has done great work in the past year and was profitable in 2020. They are accumulating cash and will hopefully be able to pay of the convertible bonds in cash. The pandemic was unforeseen, and things have changed. Some convertible bond holders have most likely been covering their short positions and going long, while others still might be hedging against their bonds that they hold.
Long story short, February 2022 will be when $OPK can free themselves from the manipulation from these bond holders. The biggest thing though is that these bond holders know their time is limited to close out their short position. They have been gradually doing so and we have seen 40,000,000 short shares be covered in the past few months. These bond holders are hoping the true value of $OPK can be suppressed until they have enough time to cheaply cover their hedged short positions. The main take away is that $OPK can close out these bonds with cash. This would mean if stock price were to correct to fair values, they may lose on covering their shorts combined with $OPK paying off the bonds in cash and not shares.

I say let’s squeeze them out of their rigged game and make them actually feel the pain of losing in the market. We need diamond hands that have enough DD to know that $OPK is extremely undervalued at these levels. Let’s make these shorts and convertible bond holders scared of the power of the common people.",$OPK : OPKO Health’s Convertible Bonds that are often used by shorts to fear monger,m25r3j,13,11,0.66,11,0,,DD,False,True,1

DAX,"Dear fellow retards and crayon-eating apes,

Today I would like to present you my first DD of a German DAX company: Deutsche Telekom, the mother company of $TMUS, which got recently included in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio by legend Warren Buffett. I would like to show you why I think that Deutsche Telekom is even a better buy than §TMUS.

**1) Solid figures, strong strategic market position, and growth outlook. Main growth drivers are an increasing glass fiber rollout potential and its 5G/cell tower portfolio.**

Deutsche Telekom is the biggest European integrated telecommunications company, with some 242 million mobile customers, 27 million fixed-network lines, and 22 million broadband lines. Deutsche Telekom is present in more than 50 countries, with its main business in Germany and US. On February 26, 2021 the Deutsche Telekom published its results for the 2020 financial year:

* Increase in **revenue of 25.4 percent to 120.1 bn. $ /101.0 billion euros**
* Adjusted **EBITDA AL increased by 41.6 percent to 41.7 bn. $/ 35.0 billion euros**
* **+388,000 broadband customer** additions in Germany
* Larger T-Mobile US records **5.5 million postpaid customer additions**
* Guidance for 2021: **adjusted EBITDA AL of around 37 billion euros** (44.1$) and **free cash flow AL of around 8.0 billion euros (9.5 $)**

The **earnings forecast shows a growth of roughly 13.2% per yea**r over the next years. The general outlook is positive.

**2) Market capitalization of Deutsche Telekom is far below its fair value with a 132 to 194% stock price potential**

Based on 2020 figures, the industry ratio of market capitalization and annual revenue for the big US players lies in a range between 1.24x to 2.24x, with a Top 3 average of 1.77x:

* **$TMUS T-Mobile US**: 153.2 bn. $ market cap / 68.4 bn. € annual revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **2.24x**
* **$ VZ Verizon Communications:** 234.5 bn. $ market cap / 128.3 bn. $ revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **1.83x**
* **$T AT&T Inc.**: 212.8 bn $ market cap / 171.8 $ revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **1.24x**
* **Deutsche Telekom:** 91.5 bn. $ market cap / 120.1 bn. $ revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **0.76x**

A fair value for Deutsche Telekom based on the Top 3 industry average of 1.77x would lead to a **fair share price of** **44.64$/37,53€,** which is a **premium of 132%** compared to the current share prices of 19.22$/16,16€. Applying the ratio of its subsidiary §TMUS of 2.24x would even lead to a **stock price potential of 194% resulting in 56.5$/47.50€ share price**. The price-to-earnings ratio is 17.6x and below the industry average of 25.3x (source: [simplywall.st](https://simplywall.st/)).

**3) The market capitalization of US subsidiary TMUS is worth 65.9 bn.$ - so the remaining business of Deutsche Telekom is worth half its revenue!**

After the Sprint-merger, Deutsche Telekom owns 43% of all shares of its subsidiary TMUS, with an option to buy the remaining 8% from Softbank until June 2024 (half of the shares for 06/2020 TMUS stock price of roughly 100$). Based on today’s value, the TMUS participation is worth 65.9 bn. $, which is already 72% of Deutsche Telekom's overall market cap. So, the remaining international business of DT with **51.7 bn. $ revenue is only evaluated 25.6 bn. $!**

**4) The analyst outlook is very promising, showing a conservative 27% upside potential over the next 12 months**

Based on 13 analyst reports, the 12 months forecast shows a possbile stock price of 24,40$/20,50€, which is a premium of roughly 27% to today's stock price. The range across all analysts is between 20.23$ (Deutsche LB) and 29,25$ (JP Morgan Chase) including 12 Buy and 1 Hold recommendations.

**5) A high dividend yield of roughly 4% over the past 20 years makes it the most stable and reliable German dividend stock.**

**6)** **Risks:**

To me, a comprehensive DD should also cover the risks involved, especially when outlook and forecast seems too good to be true,

* During the dot-com bubble, Deutsche Telekom showed a crazy race towards its ATH of 120$/100€ in 2000, followed by a crash down to 12$/10€ within the next two years. This led to trauma for many German shareholders, resulting in lethargic stock performance over the past 18 years. The high dividend yield is also a result of this crash, with management trying to please the remaining stock owners. Since DT is a German symbol of the dot-com bubble, there might be a chance that the stock is simply not reacting to the current, positive news.
* Deutsche Telekom has a high net debt of 127.4 bn. $/107.1 bn. € (2020). However, the recurring cash flow is high, covering roughly 22.2% of its debt. The interest payments are fully covered by the profit (3.1x coverage).
* Currently, 14.5% of all shares are owned by the German government which might hamper potential positive share price developments. However, German economics minister Peter Altmeier is considering reducing the German participation (January 2021). Other privatization cases show a positive stock price effect.

**Summary:**

Based on all information available, I believe that the upside potential overweighs possible downsides. Even a conservative estimate of 24,40$/20,50€ target stock price reflects a 27% price premium. I personally believe that a **fair estimate based on financial analysis would be 44.64$/37,53€, resulting in a 132% stock price performance**. Overall, I am not a financial advisor, and this is not a financial advice. I simply like the stock.",Why Deutsche Telekom has a 132% to 194% stock price potential (and is a better buy than $TMUS),m25ors,41,53,0.73,53,0,,DD,False,True,1

So, the remaining international business of DT with **51.7 bn. $ revenue is only evaluated 25.6 bn. $!**

**4) The analyst outlook is very promising, showing a conservative 27% upside potential over the next 12 months**

Based on 13 analyst reports, the 12 months forecast shows a possbile stock price of 24,40$/20,50€, which is a premium of roughly 27% to today's stock price. The range across all analysts is between 20.23$ (Deutsche LB) and 29,25$ (JP Morgan Chase) including 12 Buy and 1 Hold recommendations.

**5) A high dividend yield of roughly 4% over the past 20 years makes it the most stable and reliable German dividend stock.**

**6)** **Risks:**

To me, a comprehensive DD should also cover the risks involved, especially when outlook and forecast seems too good to be true,

* During the dot-com bubble, Deutsche Telekom showed a crazy race towards its ATH of 120$/100€ in 2000, followed by a crash down to 12$/10€ within the next two years. This led to trauma for many German shareholders, resulting in lethargic stock performance over the past 18 years. The high dividend yield is also a result of this crash, with management trying to please the remaining stock owners. Since DT is a German symbol of the dot-com bubble, there might be a chance that the stock is simply not reacting to the current, positive news.
* Deutsche Telekom has a high net debt of 127.4 bn. $/107.1 bn. € (2020). However, the recurring cash flow is high, covering roughly 22.2% of its debt. The interest payments are fully covered by the profit (3.1x coverage).
* Currently, 14.5% of all shares are owned by the German government which might hamper potential positive share price developments. However, German economics minister Peter Altmeier is considering reducing the German participation (January 2021). Other privatization cases show a positive stock price effect.

**Summary:**

Based on all information available, I believe that the upside potential overweighs possible downsides. Even a conservative estimate of 24,40$/20,50€ target stock price reflects a 27% price premium. I personally believe that a **fair estimate based on financial analysis would be 44.64$/37,53€, resulting in a 132% stock price performance**. Overall, I am not a financial advisor, and this is not a financial advice. I simply like the stock.",Why Deutsche Telekom has a 132% to 194% stock price potential (and is a better buy than $TMUS),m25ors,41,53,0.73,53,0,,DD,False,True,1

* From the image above you can gather the following information
   * This stock has a P/E of 7.5 way way way low - this is price to earnings for you apes that are still on the gorilla teet and barely understand market cap.
   * They pay a 2.00 dividend which is a 3.5% yield. Just owning the stock you will make monies.
   * They are small, 1.5B market cap, but profitable.

# The comparison to peers!!!!!!!!!!

* Look at the chart below
   * it's P/E is way better than the industry average.... 7.5 vs 21 this is incredible.
   * It's Price to cash flow is 8x better.
   * It's price to sales is nearly 9x better....... This is absolutely insane.
   * Price to sales is 4x better
   * Price to book is 6x better this

ASO,"Academy Sports is a sports and out door chain that saw 139% earnings surprise last earnings announcement and is currently the third most shorted stock at almost 40%. If you think there was institutional influence holding down GME, you haven't seen anything yet. 

ASO has a much smaller float, 32 million, compared to GME's 50m, SKT's 90m, and RKT's 106m. It also has a much smaller average daily volume, compared to the other most shorted stocks, at 1.5 million. Although $40 options just opened up, previously the only OTM options were $25, $30 and $35. If you look at the last few weeks price at expiry you will see, for instance last week, that at expiry the price was just below $25 and immediately went up past $25 after the options expired worthless. 

This is a company that had a breakout earnings beating both earnings and revenue and has another earnings announcement coming this month. Last earnings was so great because of the increased sales of guns, ammo, and out doors equipment from the quarter ending October 1. The last quarter of 2020 saw an increase in the sales of guns and ammo across the board. It also saw more school sports increase as states start to re-open. So far this quarter, which will not be in the earnings report, we saw the third highest increase in gun sales. We also see Texas and other states that are big ASO earners completely re-open. 

Getting back to institutional shenanigans. Not only do you see the price fall below the $25 call weekly on low volume trades, despite running up the day or week before, but you can also see price suppression daily. Look at the average volume of Monday's 13% run up, and then look at the volume it took to drive it back down to $25 on Tuesday. If you look at the daily chart for the past month you will see a roller coaster ride of 1-3% ups and downs hourly. Each time I've seen something like this it was either institutions ""shaking out weak hands"" or GME's first pop. 

I understand that most are diamond handing GME and it may have room to run, but I believe that not only is ASO over-shorted and will have another stellar earnings driving the price higher causing a squeeze, but that it is a fundamentally undervalued company.

I currently hold 20 April 16 $25c, and 5 April 16 $35.",ASO: Early Bird Special,m1zcsv,39,82,0.87,82,0,,DD,False,True,1

VS,"We the apes, in order to create a more perfect union, do solemnly swear to present to you all the due diligence that you will need to make an informed decision. Join me on this journey fellow banana chasers.

TLDR; AMC is being heavily shorted; AMC has potential to go to $40  Time to save AMC and make tendies while we’re at it. This is not financial advice; it was originally written in red crayons that I found shoved deep inside my nose. 

Ever since COVID came along and kept our wives' boyfriends from taking them to the movies, hedge funds have been shorting AMC. AMC was close to meeting its demise on several occasions until the sound of apes screaming “We like the stock!” could be heard. The sounds grew louder with the cult-like chants. However… one thing was missing: More Apes. This is where we come to you with the facts laid out smoother than your brain in hopes of showing you what could be the best investment decision of your life. Bananas will be flowing. Question is: Will you grab it or… peel out?

First we will start off by reminding everyone that this is not investment advice, it is just the opinion of a few smooth-brained apes who like the stock, just like you. Now, why are we diamond handing AMC? 

**AMC has solid momentum.** To back this up you can look at the chart for this. The average volume has significantly increased. Months ago, the stock rarely had more than 10M traded a day. Now it's harder to find a day with less than 100m traded shares. In the same time frame, the price has gone from almost $2 to, at the time of this writing, $9.29. This means there’s more interest and liquidity in the stock. All good things for us. 

**Theatres are reopening.** A quick google search gives you dozens of links for theatres that have already opened their doors and allowed moviegoers back in to enjoy their favorite pastime. Biden has [stated](https://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour/watch/biden-all-u-s-adults-will-have-a-covid-vaccine-by-may-101867589951) that there will be enough vaccines for everyone by May, which will allow all theatres to open at full capacity. 

**Capital raised, debt reduced.** In January AMC raised $1.2b ← with a b, in funding and paid off $600m in debt. Which leaves them with a clean bill of health and a solid ground to build up from.

**Started A Streaming Service.** They have branched out into [streaming services](https://www.amctheatres.com/about/on-demand) as well, with AMC Theatres On Demand. 

**The Chart Below Looks Amazing.** First off, it's showing a cup and handle as indicated with the yellow line. This is a bullish pattern for price and we officially broke out of the handle to the upside on March 8. If we break above the tip of the cup, there isn’t much resistance stopping AMC from filling a gap to $13 and continuing on to the $20 mark, which is where Vlad decided to manipulate (read:suppress) buying action in January.
Next, we have the elliott wave theory that AMC does a great job of following. At the very least, AMC looks like it will move up from $9 to $13; on the smaller degrees. But on the larger degrees, if we assume that Wave 1 was the January spike, then we are in the beginning of Wave 3, which under EW Rules, has a realistic target of $30-40. With enough volume, AMC could easily blow past the $13 up to $20 and eventually reach the $30-$40 range. 

https://i.imgur.com/ramEhoQ.png

**Blockbuster movies lined up/Pent up Demand.** With movies not being able to be seen in theaters, some have been put on the release back burner until they can get sufficient eyes to view them. Some of these movies include Coming 2 America, God VS King, Mortal Kombat, Black Widow & Tom Gun: Maverick.

**The discord bot don’t lie.** If it worked for DFV it can work for us!

https://i.imgur.com/nmbRPmi.png

**Short Seller Data:** Forget about the momentum and the technicals for a minute and lets talk ape to ape. We did some research and found that there is still a TON of short sellers on AMC trying to take our movie theaters away. They just won’t learn; we LIKE the stock; we LIKE our movie theaters; we WANT them to stay in business. Forget the technicals, AMC is a great buy & hold because it will keep a fundamental aspect of our social fabric intact. If theaters close down, where else will our tweens make their first sloppy moves? And don't you dare say microwave popcorn is better than the theater kind - yes, even after your wife's boyfriend reminds you he ""doesn't do salt.""

Comparing AMC to GME, AMC is being shorted a lot heavier than GME right now; the numbers don’t lie.  Take a look at what Harambe found: 

https://i.imgur.com/w6WCJag.png

Sources: Data in table from Ortex.com, iBorrowDesk.com, and fintel.io

**Fellow Smooth Brained Ape Definitions Key:**

**Free Float:** Number of shares available for trade
**Short Interest:** Number of tradable shares being shorted
**Utilization Rate:** Percentage of lendable shares that have been borrowed (most likely to short)
**Short Borrow Fee Rate:** The interest rate each borrower pays on shares borrowed for shorting purposes
**Days to Cover:** The estimated number of days it will take for shorts to cover their positions

**Harambe’s Heavenly Thoughts:** Although GME has a higher percentage of its shares on loan, AMC has more shares on loan in total that are being shorted (Compare GME’s 12M shares with AMC’s 67M shares shorted). On AMC, the shorts have already borrowed 100% of the shares available to borrow, while on GME is only at 72%. We looked at the data from January, and saw a similar spike in GME’s utilization, followed by a rapid drop before the price mooned. AMC seems to be setting up a similar scenario. Looking at the short borrow fee rate, it is now more expensive to short AMC than it is to short GME, which could increase the pressure on AMC shorts to cover. Also, AMC has a higher “Days to Cover” than GME, which means it will take shorts longer to cover, so the price spike could last longer.  What Harambe’s trying to say here is: Me like AMC. Apes stronger together. AMC to the moon.

tl;dr: The writers and DDers of this:

>Me, Ape 1: 1 contract, 90 shares. Bagholding some at $15 but bought in more at $10. 

>Ape 2: 40 contracts, 600 shares

>Ape 3: 8 contracts, 100 shares

>Ape 4: 59 spreads, 6 contracts

>Ape 5: 40 contracts, 100 shares

>Ape 6: 400 shares, 10 contracts

>Ape 7: 69 contracts, 1361 shares.

CAN,"[serious post]

I love this stock. I wish I'd bought more before, and as the price rises, I'm torn about how much more to YOLO. And something occurs to me...

No one knows how this is going to play out. We know the price must rise, but no one knows how much by. No one knows when. No one knows for how long. No one knows how much ammo the HFs have, or what the hidden rules are. No one knows the shape of the journey ahead.

Here's one thing we do know: THEY WILL CHEAT. They will use every trick in the book, then they will invent new ones. We can laugh as they dig a deeper pit with shorts and buy more dips, but even a smooth-brained crayon-eating yadda yadda something something retard should expect they they still have new tricks that we haven't seen yet.

I sense a trap.

The market mechanisms are on our side for once. If we buy *what we can afford to lose* and HOLD HOLD HOLD, either we will win or the entire market system still disintegrate. I LIKE THOSE ODDS! But this strategy depends on the HOLD HOLD HOLD part.

Fellow apes: if you can't afford to hold what you buy, DON'T buy more!

If you remortgage your house, YOLO the college fund, and get leverage up to the tits, there is a chance that the HFs will find a way to artificially (and presumably illegally) crash the price, and through whatever arcane black magic find a way to keep it low as your mortgage payments keep coming in.

STAY LIQUID, apes!

Make sure you can pay the bills!

Spend *whatever you can afford to lose* on GME, but figure out *how much that is*, and for the sake of discipline set yourself a target price to STOP buying at. Maybe stop buying at $1k, or $2k or $10k or whatever, figure out your own number IN ADVANCE and STICK TO IT.

Gambling is an addiction, and even if you win, addiction can shatter families. If you buy at $5k and the HFs manage to drag the price down to £100 for six months, you're going to have to look at your wife and her boyfriend through the kitchen window every morning, knowing that the price will spike again but still having to sleep on the lawn.

DO NOT PUT YOURSELF IN A POSITION WHERE YOU'RE UNDER PRESSURE TO SELL.

SET A TARGET TO STOP BUYING.

GET AS MUCH AS YOU CAN BEFORE THAT POINT.

There are now several trillion dollar companies. The new asset class that didn't exist a few years ago which must not be named here is worth well over a trillion. GME, well fucking GME, Hertz, all that shit. This is what the end of a [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp) looks like. The gains during the final stretch are unbelievably high. With the returns from the market recently, it begs the question if the bull market is coming to an end.

## Blow-Off Top

A “blow-off top” is when the price of a stock or general market increases sharply, only to be followed by an as sharp decrease in price.

>*A blow-off top is a chart pattern that shows a steep and rapid increase in a security’s price and trading* [*volume*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp) *followed by a steep and rapid drop in price usually on significant or high volume as well.*[*Investopedia*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blowofftop.asp)

As a bull market nears its ends, the gains are too good to miss out on. As people buy into the market, fearing they will miss out on gains, it drives the price up to unstable values. Investors who have been in the market long enough, take their profits. As people start to sell and lock in gains, the price drops, causing a frenzy as others try to get their money out before the price goes even lower.

## Why the Current Rally Might End

The S&P 500 had its longest bull run in history ended in February because of the coronavirus. After a decade of steady gains, things came crashing down in a little over a month. Now the market is back like it never left. The market is up 65% since it bottomed out less than a year ago. *65% return in less than a year!*

The S&P closed in October at $3,269. It closed the first week of January at $3,824. That is a 16% gain in 2+ months.

[Tesla has been on another level lately](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/elon-musk-just-became-the-richest-person-6a0675911677). Not only did they [dominate 2020 ](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/2020-stock-market-review-b736a4ecff67)by returning 700%, the stock was up another 22% in the first week of 2021. How much more steam does this thing have?

As stock prices keep soaring, when will people start to realize profits? Some may be inclined to take their profits now while others may still in and not want to take their gains until it is too late.

When Q4 earnings start getting announced, how will the market fare? Will analysts be happy if companies' top or bottom lines are still too far from pre-pandemic numbers?

With stocks at all-time highs, it may seem the risk is greater than the reward going into the next few weeks.

## Why The Bull Market Will Likely Continue

Which of the many reasons do you want to hear first?

I’ll start with the latest from Joe Biden, as [NBC News said](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/joe-biden-wants-set-aside-deficit-concerns-invest-ailing-u-n1253638),

>\[Biden\] favors [setting aside concerns about the federal deficit](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/biden-s-agenda-gets-fighting-chance-after-democrats-capture-senate-n1253305) in order to spend more money to boost the ailing American economy.

This is on top of the nearly $4 trillion the US government has printed out in stimulus money in 2020. Easy money means easy profits right? As more money has been circulated, it has found its way to the stock market and inflated prices. With more government stimulus coming there is reason to believe the stock market will react the same.

And as we know, the stock market looks to the future. What’s in the past doesn’t matter. The millions unemployed, rising coronavirus cases, growing debt, potential inflation, or slowing global growth is history. We have vaccines now. The end is in sight.

The news of vaccines and thoughts of a “normal” society in the [second half of 2021](https://medium.com/technology-hits/why-google-can-be-the-best-performing-tech-stock-of-2021-25dff4a73fc7) is music to investors' ears. With life back to normal and an open economy, people will abandon these record-high saving rates and go back to increased spending, which should benefit companies and therefore stock prices.

Need a [technical reason](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/three-technical-indicators-for-beginner-investors-to-know-3d06758e9d82) to think the market is not topping off right now? Look at the chart of the S&P 500 from any time to today. 1 month, 1 year, 1 decade, 1 century.

AMZN,"First we can take a quick walk through the history of how this all started, and explain how none of what's happening was ""our fault"". GameStop had, admittedly, followed a pretty outdated business model since the early 2010s. The gaming industry, like many others, was moving digital and Gamestop lagged far behind this trend.

Hedge funds, rightfully so to an extent, began shorting Gamestop in 2016. They began shorting it around $40 and rode the wave down. But they kept getting more and more greedy. Yadda yadda, sub-$4 and 140% short.

Deep Fucking Value, Michael J Burry and others saw how undervalued Gamestop was at $4, and they started buying and HODLing shares. Just how undervalued were they when people started catching on in 2019/2020? Well, at the end of 2019, Gamestop had about $1.6B in cash and about $800M in debt - or a net cash position of +$800M. The market cap of Gamestop was $276M when the share price was $4. Completely ignoring any future cash flows, you could purchase a share worth nearly $12 in cash for $4. *Hedge funds were still shorting the stock at this point.*

Skip forward, Ryan Cohen becomes the catalyst that Sparks the shitkeg of short squeeze that hedge funds created, and off we went. Ryan Cohen, and his team, are the key. And what this thesis relies on **is already happening.**

Ryan Cohen and his team have begun taking over the board in what seems to be an amicable fashion. At least in the sense that it is not a hostile takeover. They've already ousted their dead weight CFO and have put in motion the new company vision to be an e-commerce retailer first, physical location game distributor second. That seems like a difficult transition to make...

Except Gamestop already has an online presence, already does e-commerce, has over 56 million subscribers to their online membership and increased their e-commerce sales by nearly 400% YoY **BEFORE Ryan Cohen became involved.**

So what's so special about Ryan Cohen? Well.. let's chew on that question for a second. *He turned a pet good company into a $30billion+ e-commerce giant.* Which gets us into the fundamentals. How does the market typically value e-commerce businesses? Many of them don't actually make a profit every year. They're valued based on future growth potential, usually based on a multiple of sales. Because e-commerce doesn't come with the overhead of physical retailers, investors will tolerate negative earnings in order to invest in rapid sustained growth, counting on them eventually becoming profitable.

Let's start with Chewy. In 2020, they did $6.46B in revenue and -$174M in net income. They're trading at a market cap of almost $34B, which is just over five times their revenue. Seems fairly reasonable.

Let's check in on our favorite gaming destination. In 2020, they did $5.16B in revenue and -$275M in net income. Not far off from Chewy, especially when you consider how much of Gamestop was still brick and mortar during a pandemic (oh and Chewy being fully e-commerce during a pandemic). GameStop, even after today, is trading at a market cap of $17B, which is just over three times revenue.

So two e-commerce companies. One built by Ryan Cohen, and one currently being led by Ryan Cohen. Trading at very different multiples. If we applied Chewys multiple to Gamestop, we would get a market cap of about $26B or a share price of about $377. That's a fair market value shareprice. **$377**. That does not consider a gamma or short squeeze at all. That is simply an efficient market pricing it as it should be valued.

Let's check some other e-commerce companies to make sure we are being reasonable.

- EBAY trades at a multiple of 3.72 times revenue
- ETSY trades at a multiple of 15.11 times revenue
- PINS trades at a multiple of 23.20 times revenue
- AMZN trades at a multiple of 4.00 times revenue

There are clearly outliers, on the high side. Industry norms are typically 3-5x revenue for established businesses. When you anticipate strong near-term growth, as in the case of ETSY and PINS, you can see significantly higher multiples.

Using these valuations, we can confidently say that Gamestop is currently flirting with the low end of fair value, and has about 40% upside if we view them as an established business without extraordinary growth expectations. Except. We kind of do expect them to grow.

Have I mentioned that nobody is considering their access to the e-gaming industry? Becoming a sponsor, or even facilitator of e-sporting events. Leagues, championships, etc. E-sports is a global industry that currently sees about $1B in revenue annually. This is expected to grow exponentially over the next decade, with most projections putting growth at 50-60% within the next two years, and continuing beyond that. Gamestop already has a Gamestop Performance Center, which is essentially a venue used for hosting major e-sporting events, as well as a host for training facilities. They've already tapped the market before Ryan Cohen, and his team will be able to truly capitalize on the market.

Then we have live streaming, and potential acquisitions. At some point, it's likely that they will do an offering to raise capital. Spoiler, they don't currently need capital, but could deploy equity capital toward specific initiatives. Like purchasing an established platform to distribute electronic game downloads. Or purchase an established platform for live streaming. These initiatives don't have to be through acquisitions, but if they choose to, they will be able to afford to.

Oh yeah, PC gaming as well. It's been confirmed by several here and elsewhere that Gamestop is adding a feature to many of their stores. A ""Build-A-PC"" workstation. You can buy parts and build your PC in the store. The PC gaming industry is currently $38billion annually. It's expected to grow another 10% in the next few years. Another industry with rapid growth potential that Gamestop has already tapped into.

What does this all mean? It means that if we consider Gamestop to be an e-commerce retailer with modest growth potential, the fair market value is somewhere between $230-385 a share. If we got wild and said they had the growth potential of something like ETSY, they would be worth $1,121 per share. I'd say they have room for more than modest growth, but not quite the potential of ETSY. Let's use about 5.6 as a multiple which would give us a **fair market value of $420 per share.**

#Tl;dr: Based on Gamestops full commitment to being an e-commerce retailer, the fair market value of the company is between $15-26billion, or a share price of $230-385.

By the way, this is completely ignoring the fact that we are in the midst of repeated small gamma squeezes and a looming mother of all short squeezes. As a long term investment, Gamestop has the potential to be trading close to and above $400 per share. That is if the market is truly efficient and values Gamestop **based on fundamentals and no outside factors.**

Deep Fucking Value, Michael J Burry and others saw how undervalued Gamestop was at $4, and they started buying and HODLing shares. Just how undervalued were they when people started catching on in 2019/2020? Well, at the end of 2019, Gamestop had about $1.6B in cash and about $800M in debt - or a net cash position of +$800M. The market cap of Gamestop was $276M when the share price was $4. Completely ignoring any future cash flows, you could purchase a share worth nearly $12 in cash for $4. *Hedge funds were still shorting the stock at this point.*

Skip forward, Ryan Cohen becomes the catalyst that Sparks the shitkeg of short squeeze that hedge funds created, and off we went. Ryan Cohen, and his team, are the key. And what this thesis relies on **is already happening.**

Ryan Cohen and his team have begun taking over the board in what seems to be an amicable fashion. At least in the sense that it is not a hostile takeover. They've already ousted their dead weight CFO and have put in motion the new company vision to be an e-commerce retailer first, physical location game distributor second. That seems like a difficult transition to make...

Except Gamestop already has an online presence, already does e-commerce, has over 56 million subscribers to their online membership and increased their e-commerce sales by nearly 400% YoY **BEFORE Ryan Cohen became involved.**

So what's so special about Ryan Cohen? Well.. let's chew on that question for a second. *He turned a pet good company into a $30billion+ e-commerce giant.* Which gets us into the fundamentals. How does the market typically value e-commerce businesses? Many of them don't actually make a profit every year. They're valued based on future growth potential, usually based on a multiple of sales. Because e-commerce doesn't come with the overhead of physical retailers, investors will tolerate negative earnings in order to invest in rapid sustained growth, counting on them eventually becoming profitable.

Let's start with Chewy. In 2020, they did $6.46B in revenue and -$174M in net income. They're trading at a market cap of almost $34B, which is just over five times their revenue. Seems fairly reasonable.

Let's check in on our favorite gaming destination. In 2020, they did $5.16B in revenue and -$275M in net income. Not far off from Chewy, especially when you consider how much of Gamestop was still brick and mortar during a pandemic (oh and Chewy being fully e-commerce during a pandemic). GameStop, even after today, is trading at a market cap of $17B, which is just over three times revenue.

So two e-commerce companies. One built by Ryan Cohen, and one currently being led by Ryan Cohen. Trading at very different multiples. If we applied Chewys multiple to Gamestop, we would get a market cap of about $26B or a share price of about $377. That's a fair market value shareprice. **$377**. That does not consider a gamma or short squeeze at all. That is simply an efficient market pricing it as it should be valued.

Let's check some other e-commerce companies to make sure we are being reasonable.

- EBAY trades at a multiple of 3.72 times revenue
- ETSY trades at a multiple of 15.11 times revenue
- PINS trades at a multiple of 23.20 times revenue
- AMZN trades at a multiple of 4.00 times revenue

There are clearly outliers, on the high side. Industry norms are typically 3-5x revenue for established businesses. When you anticipate strong near-term growth, as in the case of ETSY and PINS, you can see significantly higher multiples.

Using these valuations, we can confidently say that Gamestop is currently flirting with the low end of fair value, and has about 40% upside if we view them as an established business without extraordinary growth expectations. Except. We kind of do expect them to grow.

Have I mentioned that nobody is considering their access to the e-gaming industry? Becoming a sponsor, or even facilitator of e-sporting events. Leagues, championships, etc. E-sports is a global industry that currently sees about $1B in revenue annually. This is expected to grow exponentially over the next decade, with most projections putting growth at 50-60% within the next two years, and continuing beyond that. Gamestop already has a Gamestop Performance Center, which is essentially a venue used for hosting major e-sporting events, as well as a host for training facilities. They've already tapped the market before Ryan Cohen, and his team will be able to truly capitalize on the market.

Then we have live streaming, and potential acquisitions. At some point, it's likely that they will do an offering to raise capital. Spoiler, they don't currently need capital, but could deploy equity capital toward specific initiatives. Like purchasing an established platform to distribute electronic game downloads. Or purchase an established platform for live streaming. These initiatives don't have to be through acquisitions, but if they choose to, they will be able to afford to.

Oh yeah, PC gaming as well. It's been confirmed by several here and elsewhere that Gamestop is adding a feature to many of their stores. A ""Build-A-PC"" workstation. You can buy parts and build your PC in the store. The PC gaming industry is currently $38billion annually. It's expected to grow another 10% in the next few years. Another industry with rapid growth potential that Gamestop has already tapped into.

What does this all mean? It means that if we consider Gamestop to be an e-commerce retailer with modest growth potential, the fair market value is somewhere between $230-385 a share. If we got wild and said they had the growth potential of something like ETSY, they would be worth $1,121 per share. I'd say they have room for more than modest growth, but not quite the potential of ETSY. Let's use about 5.6 as a multiple which would give us a **fair market value of $420 per share.**

#Tl;dr: Based on Gamestops full commitment to being an e-commerce retailer, the fair market value of the company is between $15-26billion, or a share price of $230-385.

By the way, this is completely ignoring the fact that we are in the midst of repeated small gamma squeezes and a looming mother of all short squeezes. As a long term investment, Gamestop has the potential to be trading close to and above $400 per share. That is if the market is truly efficient and values Gamestop **based on fundamentals and no outside factors.**

EA,"PSA $RBLX Direct Listing opens on 3/10. 

From Bloomberg

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roblox-direct-listing-reference-price-221415677.html


“The New York Stock Exchange set a reference price of $45 for the direct listing of Roblox Corp., the online games company that originally planned to go public via a traditional initial public offering.


Roblox’s shares will begin trading Wednesday without the company raising any capital. As with previous direct listings, the company won’t issue new shares at a set price. Instead, current investors can simply begin selling shares based on demand when trading opens.”

This means that current share holders who paid $2.50 a share can start selling at $45 per share, as long as demand holds up.  

Sooooo, therefore if we don’t buy it day one, we can buy it cheaper later on. . 

And their financials : 


For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Roblox had a consolidated net loss of $197 million on revenue of $614 million.

They pull in around 200m a QTR but overspend by about $60m a month.    Eeesh.  Huge losses.

Compare this to EA Games, which has a similar market cap ($30bln) but over the same period had sales of $4bln and net PROFIT of 900m (almost as much as RBLX’s total revenue).

Before plowing your wife’s boyfriends . . Money . . Into $RBLX take a careful compare / contrast w other companies in the same industry.  Hugely profitable and popular Minecraft sold for $10 bln.  Is $RBLX really worth $30 BLN day 1 with 0 earnings?

FB,"I’m thinking of going all in on Roblox tomorrow morning, so I’m doing my DD as I type this up.

Roblox made $923.9 million of revenue last year 2020 - but reported a loss of $253.3 million....

Roblox is NOT currently profitable.

Paying the Roblox content creators 30% of revenue is $277.17 million (almost what they posted as loss, which is fishy), but leaves $696.73 million of revenue.

So let’s try to figure out Operating Expenses...

7 executives according to https://corp.roblox.com/people/ - whom are reportedly very well compensated. But I think the website is out of date, or skimmed on purpose - I’m a tech infrastructure guy and I know of Dan Williams hired at Roblox in 2017 (moving from Dropbox, before that Facebook) to tackle their infrastructure issues - https://corp.roblox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TechCrunch-Ron-Miller-How-Roblox-Completely-Transformed-its-Tech-Stack.pdf More on him and the infrastructure later.

So this site says that they are up to 26 executives- https://craft.co/roblox/executives

Ok, let’s low ball at $3 million a year each exec (unknown bonuses) (https://fintechzoom.com/fintech_news_roblox/heres-how-much-robloxs-executives-and-cofounders-make/ ) minus $78 million = $618.73 million revenue.

They currently have 960 employees. https://www.barrons.com/articles/roblox-sets-date-to-go-public-through-a-direct-listing-51614036401

953 non exec employees. Some are in China, some make more than others. Majority have a Silicon Valley engineering salary, benefits + perks - let’s estimate and say those 953 employees average a cost of $300k a year. That’s another $285.9 million in employee wages, leaves us with $332.83 million left of the revenue for 2020.

$332.83 million estimated left in revenue plus the reported $253.3 million reported loss for 2020 is still $586.13 million left to cover.

Data Center + migration costs. Back to Dan Williams. His purpose was to reduce the infrastructure costs by moving everything they could off of AWS and Windows servers. AWS cloud provider costs + running everything on Windows servers with a cost of license per server - is fucking expensive. My best guess and hope for investing is that this cost is what got rolled up into the $253.3 million reported loss for 2020. This meant setting up 5+ year contracts with Data Center and POP co-location providers (point of presence, where the Comcast, Verizon, etc ISPs hand off their internet traffic). Roblox wouldn’t have the FB type cash to build their own data centers, so you are talking about $30k a month lease per site. At least 8x Data Centers in the US with 1-3 POPs per DC. ~24 contracts at $30k a month = $8.64 million a year. Similar costs in China, maybe - I dunno the network layout there or how things go with dealing with Chinese government, hence the deal with Tencent.
The cost for populating these Data Centers and POPs with hardware, and performing the migration is the upfront expensive part. Buying the server hardware, buying the network equipment - paying for your own network transit instead of leasing from AWS. Heavy upfront costs, but much much cheaper in the long run than AWS bills.

But I cannot figure anything that would add up to $586.13 million, even if they were giving blank checks and made subpar deals with vars and vendors where everyone got a very hefty cut to make things happen fast and smooth. I also don’t know what existing contracts they might have had to break / pay off to go the route that would be best going forward.
I’m gonna rough estimate $150 million on infrastructure equipment and another $150 million on contracts and vendor costs. $586.13 million minus that very rough $300 million brings me down to ~$286 million of costs unaccounted for (again, almost their reported loss - still fishy).

And I doubt they have been able to move all of their services off of AWS - which means they still pay AWS bills, and depending on what services those are - they could be hefty bills.
I do know that if Roblox had planned better from the start - they wouldn’t even be going public. Optimized servers and back end code on free Linux distos, even running on a cloud provider - would be profitable with their volume. Look at Steam...

So, long term:
Roblox has almost 300 open job positions https://corp.roblox.com/careers/ between US and China. They are pushing hard to expand into China through a ownership partnership with Tencent (look them up if you are not into gaming). They are actively working to right the ship and they have hired high level executives and engineers who have past experience producing results for other Fortune 100 companies.

I spent this time to look into things I was questionable about and still the $253 million loss on ~$1 billion revenue. I didn’t fully answer my own questions, but got a reasonable explanation for myself.

I’m not selling my GME or rest of my folio to go RBLX - but I am going to go in with what I’ve got tomorrow am. I’m a high risk, short term profit guy - so that’s I’m betting on. But this could still be the direct listing IPO that tanks after opening.

# ""Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win"" - Sun Tzu

**Let that sink in for a second, chew on a few crayons... okay good.**

&#x200B;

*The win was identifying the fucking shorting. The next win was having Papa Cohen take the wheel. The next win was these morons doubling down their short positions, hiding them in ETFs and generally just being smooth brained HF's who wouldn't accept that they'd already lost.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Okay, so I've been here since early January.

I've watched since a few days before the first spike, I invested because I like the stock, and I invested high at the time \~$300 a share.

I watched GME climb, I watched the switch get flipped and I watched it fall to discounted rates. I bought more. I bought more recently, knowing the war was not yet over. We had won, but they had yet to admit defeat. I held, I bought the dip, the cycle repeated.

A lot of us did.

I've been here, reading every post in ""Hot"" first, then every post in ""New"" after, then every post in ""Controversial"" after that.. Then jumping sub Reddits to see what's going on with WSB (and if I'm feeling cheeky GME\_Meltdown lol) .. The point is, in terms of GME alone, I've read a \*LOT\*.

This topic today is something I've seen people touch on, but in reality is the one defining principle you apes all need to remember going forward.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# ""0 Risk = 0 Fucks."" - The method to attaining true 💎🙌

[We will still have YOLOs, people who have plenty of disposable income, and just smooth brained apes. But hear me out.](https://preview.redd.it/0qhnzm2rm5m61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aedb83543448c586fc3415ffe4c0c991f6bd16e4)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Let me paint a picture of why this is important.*

&#x200B;

Let's say Billy the Ape works a middle class job, earns say 50k a year.. supports a family, has debts, and is average in the financial sense. (Giant 💎 nuts though)

Billy sees what's happening and scrapes together life savings, using all of his available cash to get as many 🍌 🍌 🍌 as Billy can afford.

Now, imagine Billy being here in January when the first spray of ape shit hit the fan and he loses upwards of 80% of his 🍌..

Being the ""predatory"" 🦍 Billy is, he HODLs strong.. and in fact uses what he can from his pay to even average down his position and buy more 🍌 🍌 . Smart Ape.

Still.... at the back of his mind, the mountains of FUD, and the potential unknown risks involved in interstellar 🚀 travel still exist.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**It does in every ape. This is normal.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How does one successfully remove all of this risk? ->! I will tell you. Soon Ape. Keep reading. Good ape.!<

&#x200B;

[Your Ape family - be it your immediate family, others around you who you support.. \*AND\* each of you here.](https://preview.redd.it/r3qxmmbum5m61.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=114542bfd9691be40edcc93e5f18397d360b5c2e)

&#x200B;

Each ape is an individual, each ape has their own family of apes to provide for. But each ape also trusts other apes in this whole saga.. with good reason. We have proven our staunch support, we like the stock. And every sign we see (confirmation bias or not) leads us to believe our DD, and that of others is spot on. So what comes next?

&#x200B;

# The BIGGEST test of 💎🙌 comes at 10k, 100k, 500k .. $1mil+

&#x200B;

*It's easy to hold when you have nothing left to lose - (Sitting at -80% in the red, ""Fuck them, I ain't leaving!)*

&#x200B;

*It's easy to hold when you've broke even - (Only up from here right?)*

&#x200B;

*It's easy to hold when you're double your money - (Look at me guys, I'm a mini-DFV, to the moon!!* 🚀🚀🚀)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# It's NOT going to be easy to hold at 10x or 20x or 100x your investment.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[How you WILL feel holding all those unrealised tendies.](https://preview.redd.it/lkdpir0xm5m61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc890a0d7215309daa5d8d6a7e31f1ea21af4de9)

&#x200B;

Essentially, each ape that hasn't been exposed to this kind of cash before, will be Atlas, you must be ready to shoulder the weight of the world as it if it depends on you.

There are already posts about what people will do, how they are calculating their earnings from holding etc. This is great, and apes are excited which they should be.

But, when the price continues to roll higher, and Apes start seeing chunks of money they've never once held in their accounts before, they will consider 📄🙌 and taking their ""win"" and going quite and spitefully watching as the show goes on.

&#x200B;

# Do not be that ape.

&#x200B;

With that being said..... The one true tactic to forming those diamond hands we all talk about is:

&#x200B;

# COVER YOUR INITIAL FUCKING INVESTMENT! 💎🙌

&#x200B;

It's really that simple.

&#x200B;

I am \*NOT\* telling you to give up your 🍌's --- This is the \*REASON\* this is happening. I'm not going into the DD, but you know the situation with the shorts and there's posts even as recent as \*TODAY\* suggesting that they just keep digging deeper.

&#x200B;

This is fkn mint for apes.

&#x200B;

But, there will come a price point - Where you can recoup your initial investment for relatively few 🍌.

&#x200B;

Before you shout ""REEEEE SHILL"" --- No, I will hold a share or two until the very end and most likely find some way to print it and put it on a wall in my girlfriends boyfriends mansion.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**But.. Here's an example:**

&#x200B;

Billy the Ape buy 50 🍌 @ 150 = $7500

Billy HODLS 🍌 - Price Rises.

🍌 rises to $1k - Billy releases 8 Bananas.

(EDIT:  Hypothetically Billy could also do this - **🍌 rises to $9001 (over 9000) - Billy releases 1 singular banana and covers all his initial cost and takes the wife and her boyfriend out for expensive McDonalds.. leaving 49 🍌 for fuck you money**)

&#x200B;

Billy retains 42 🍌 **- AT ZERO FUCKING COST. ZERO. BILLY NOW HAS HIS CASH AND 42 FUCKING BANANAS**

&#x200B;

Billy waits patiently, even buys some more 🍌if there's a dip (spoiler alert, there will be) - But in general Billy sits and watches his FREE money, make MORE free money!

&#x200B;

Billy is a smart 🦍

&#x200B;

(This is also down to personal circumstances - Only your ape brain knows how bigger risk you took on this, so adjust the example and cover price accordingly - Not advice. Fact.)

And now..

# Billy no longer has any RISK, or any FEAR of losing what was already his.

&#x200B;

# This empowers Billy.

&#x200B;

[BILLY CAN'T LOSE NOW, ONLY WIN, QUESTION IS \\""WIN HOW MUCH?\\"" 💎🙌](https://preview.redd.it/llwytxlzm5m61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d65d718cd902554ca26423734f66e971cd371a67)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chew a few more crayons, take a break, come back. There's more to this. I'll wait.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now my brother, who I recently told about GME, laughed at me. Thought I was wearing a tin foil hat. In fact a few people did.

They have all got their own 🍌 🍌 🍌 🍌 now. Some got a lot, others got 1 🍌 - It all counts.

If you can't talk the DD to people, share the Reddit, or even just some of the epic posts that have been done.

Media is going to report on this less and less as we climb until they can't ignore it.

You're \*IN\* the ape camp, you see each others ideas and DD on the daily.

95% of the population still don't... or if they did, decided they don't want to know.

Share the ideas with those you know, who stand to benefit from it. @$250 it's still a bargain.

Papa Cohen will knock this out of the park. Trust.

&#x200B;

[Yep. This dude. Fkn great for us apes, and the A-Team he brought with him! ](https://preview.redd.it/2dvn1t27n5m61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3161a08d422070f3ffbf455ba7ff400d86336fc)

&#x200B;

# Flash forward a few weeks or months...

# (Well.. it could still be sooner, but let's pace ourselves. Don't $CUM too soon! More apes will want in on this orgy.)

&#x200B;

Stonk is up, volume is miniscule, and we are jumping not by $1 or $2 in a movement, but $10's and $100's in a movement.

This \*WILL\* happen.. when the squeeze begins it will move at a pace you will struggle to comprehend with your smooth brains. This is good. It means it's beginning. Read the DD's - The squeeze will not be squoze in a day. But you WILL know when it starts.

&#x200B;

# Part 2: The End Game.

This part comes later... could be weeks, could be months. Do not limit yourself by time. You have now set yourself in a position where there is only profit, no risk. Do not look at the money going up and consider it a risk.

You never had these 🍌🍌 before all this, and this will be the one and only 🚀🚀🚀🚀 fkn moonshot you will get. With the world watching, the new rules to be imposed, and the serious boning that some of these HFs (Hi Melvin) are getting from Game Stop..

&#x200B;

**Shit will change.**

&#x200B;

Now it may change in favour of us little guys, I am optimistic it will. But never again, will we see such blatant manipulation in the market, the inaction of regulatory bodies, or a chance like this again.

&#x200B;

# ""How does this smooth brained ape sell at the tippy top?""

&#x200B;

Short Answer: YOU DON'T

Longer Answer: In theory, ""The Way"" will be to let a small portion of shares go at a time, never dump your full load in one go. People have spoken about TA and reading the graphs to know when this will start and end. It likely won't work .. so you're best off doing something like:

&#x200B;

# Billy Holds 42 🍌 (Risk Free bananas, the sweetest kind)

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 1k

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 2k

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 4k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 8k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 16k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 32k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 64k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 128k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 256k

... You get Billys point.  


\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\* - Billy is kinda pissed at the FUD and that blatant MSM cuck up the other day reporting early on a dump. So... Given the fact that GME Ownership is around 300% of float.. (With Retail unknown.. but I would imagine very high) We have \*NEW\* figures to potentially ""cover"" at.. See below for Billys revised listing:

&#x200B;

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 100k

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 200k

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 400k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 800k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 1.6m

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 3.2m

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 6.4m

&#x200B;

And at this stage, Billy has made .. **\~ $511,000** profit from a $7500 outlay (which was already covered) and only used 9 🍌 ... Billy \*STILL\* has 33 🍌 left.... That's a fkn lot.

&#x200B;

Billy hasn't dumped 42 🍌 @ 1 price, and watched it climb and felt like he missed out, he also didn't greatly affect the other apes as he did this.

Okay, so I've been here since early January.

I've watched since a few days before the first spike, I invested because I like the stock, and I invested high at the time \~$300 a share.

I watched GME climb, I watched the switch get flipped and I watched it fall to discounted rates. I bought more. I bought more recently, knowing the war was not yet over. We had won, but they had yet to admit defeat. I held, I bought the dip, the cycle repeated.

A lot of us did.

I've been here, reading every post in ""Hot"" first, then every post in ""New"" after, then every post in ""Controversial"" after that.. Then jumping sub Reddits to see what's going on with WSB (and if I'm feeling cheeky GME\_Meltdown lol) .. The point is, in terms of GME alone, I've read a \*LOT\*.

This topic today is something I've seen people touch on, but in reality is the one defining principle you apes all need to remember going forward.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# ""0 Risk = 0 Fucks."" - The method to attaining true 💎🙌

[We will still have YOLOs, people who have plenty of disposable income, and just smooth brained apes. But hear me out.](https://preview.redd.it/0qhnzm2rm5m61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aedb83543448c586fc3415ffe4c0c991f6bd16e4)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Let me paint a picture of why this is important.*

&#x200B;

Let's say Billy the Ape works a middle class job, earns say 50k a year.. supports a family, has debts, and is average in the financial sense. (Giant 💎 nuts though)

Billy sees what's happening and scrapes together life savings, using all of his available cash to get as many 🍌 🍌 🍌 as Billy can afford.

Now, imagine Billy being here in January when the first spray of ape shit hit the fan and he loses upwards of 80% of his 🍌..

Being the ""predatory"" 🦍 Billy is, he HODLs strong.. and in fact uses what he can from his pay to even average down his position and buy more 🍌 🍌 . Smart Ape.

Still.... at the back of his mind, the mountains of FUD, and the potential unknown risks involved in interstellar 🚀 travel still exist.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**It does in every ape. This is normal.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How does one successfully remove all of this risk? ->! I will tell you. Soon Ape. Keep reading. Good ape.!<

&#x200B;

[Your Ape family - be it your immediate family, others around you who you support.. \*AND\* each of you here.](https://preview.redd.it/r3qxmmbum5m61.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=114542bfd9691be40edcc93e5f18397d360b5c2e)

&#x200B;

Each ape is an individual, each ape has their own family of apes to provide for. But each ape also trusts other apes in this whole saga.. with good reason. We have proven our staunch support, we like the stock. And every sign we see (confirmation bias or not) leads us to believe our DD, and that of others is spot on. So what comes next?

&#x200B;

# The BIGGEST test of 💎🙌 comes at 10k, 100k, 500k .. $1mil+

&#x200B;

*It's easy to hold when you have nothing left to lose - (Sitting at -80% in the red, ""Fuck them, I ain't leaving!)*

&#x200B;

*It's easy to hold when you've broke even - (Only up from here right?)*

&#x200B;

*It's easy to hold when you're double your money - (Look at me guys, I'm a mini-DFV, to the moon!!* 🚀🚀🚀)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# It's NOT going to be easy to hold at 10x or 20x or 100x your investment.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[How you WILL feel holding all those unrealised tendies.](https://preview.redd.it/lkdpir0xm5m61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc890a0d7215309daa5d8d6a7e31f1ea21af4de9)

&#x200B;

Essentially, each ape that hasn't been exposed to this kind of cash before, will be Atlas, you must be ready to shoulder the weight of the world as it if it depends on you.

There are already posts about what people will do, how they are calculating their earnings from holding etc. This is great, and apes are excited which they should be.

But, when the price continues to roll higher, and Apes start seeing chunks of money they've never once held in their accounts before, they will consider 📄🙌 and taking their ""win"" and going quite and spitefully watching as the show goes on.

&#x200B;

# Do not be that ape.

&#x200B;

With that being said..... The one true tactic to forming those diamond hands we all talk about is:

&#x200B;

# COVER YOUR INITIAL FUCKING INVESTMENT! 💎🙌

&#x200B;

It's really that simple.

&#x200B;

I am \*NOT\* telling you to give up your 🍌's --- This is the \*REASON\* this is happening. I'm not going into the DD, but you know the situation with the shorts and there's posts even as recent as \*TODAY\* suggesting that they just keep digging deeper.

&#x200B;

This is fkn mint for apes.

&#x200B;

But, there will come a price point - Where you can recoup your initial investment for relatively few 🍌.

&#x200B;

Before you shout ""REEEEE SHILL"" --- No, I will hold a share or two until the very end and most likely find some way to print it and put it on a wall in my girlfriends boyfriends mansion.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**But.. Here's an example:**

&#x200B;

Billy the Ape buy 50 🍌 @ 150 = $7500

Billy HODLS 🍌 - Price Rises.

🍌 rises to $1k - Billy releases 8 Bananas.

(EDIT:  Hypothetically Billy could also do this - **🍌 rises to $9001 (over 9000) - Billy releases 1 singular banana and covers all his initial cost and takes the wife and her boyfriend out for expensive McDonalds.. leaving 49 🍌 for fuck you money**)

&#x200B;

Billy retains 42 🍌 **- AT ZERO FUCKING COST. ZERO. BILLY NOW HAS HIS CASH AND 42 FUCKING BANANAS**

&#x200B;

Billy waits patiently, even buys some more 🍌if there's a dip (spoiler alert, there will be) - But in general Billy sits and watches his FREE money, make MORE free money!

&#x200B;

Billy is a smart 🦍

&#x200B;

(This is also down to personal circumstances - Only your ape brain knows how bigger risk you took on this, so adjust the example and cover price accordingly - Not advice. Fact.)

And now..

# Billy no longer has any RISK, or any FEAR of losing what was already his.

&#x200B;

# This empowers Billy.

&#x200B;

[BILLY CAN'T LOSE NOW, ONLY WIN, QUESTION IS \\""WIN HOW MUCH?\\"" 💎🙌](https://preview.redd.it/llwytxlzm5m61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d65d718cd902554ca26423734f66e971cd371a67)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chew a few more crayons, take a break, come back. There's more to this. I'll wait.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now my brother, who I recently told about GME, laughed at me. Thought I was wearing a tin foil hat. In fact a few people did.

They have all got their own 🍌 🍌 🍌 🍌 now. Some got a lot, others got 1 🍌 - It all counts.

If you can't talk the DD to people, share the Reddit, or even just some of the epic posts that have been done.

Media is going to report on this less and less as we climb until they can't ignore it.

You're \*IN\* the ape camp, you see each others ideas and DD on the daily.

95% of the population still don't... or if they did, decided they don't want to know.

Share the ideas with those you know, who stand to benefit from it. @$250 it's still a bargain.

Papa Cohen will knock this out of the park. Trust.

&#x200B;

[Yep. This dude. Fkn great for us apes, and the A-Team he brought with him! ](https://preview.redd.it/2dvn1t27n5m61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3161a08d422070f3ffbf455ba7ff400d86336fc)

&#x200B;

# Flash forward a few weeks or months...

# (Well.. it could still be sooner, but let's pace ourselves. Don't $CUM too soon! More apes will want in on this orgy.)

&#x200B;

Stonk is up, volume is miniscule, and we are jumping not by $1 or $2 in a movement, but $10's and $100's in a movement.

This \*WILL\* happen.. when the squeeze begins it will move at a pace you will struggle to comprehend with your smooth brains. This is good. It means it's beginning. Read the DD's - The squeeze will not be squoze in a day. But you WILL know when it starts.

&#x200B;

# Part 2: The End Game.

This part comes later... could be weeks, could be months. Do not limit yourself by time. You have now set yourself in a position where there is only profit, no risk. Do not look at the money going up and consider it a risk.

You never had these 🍌🍌 before all this, and this will be the one and only 🚀🚀🚀🚀 fkn moonshot you will get. With the world watching, the new rules to be imposed, and the serious boning that some of these HFs (Hi Melvin) are getting from Game Stop..

&#x200B;

**Shit will change.**

&#x200B;

Now it may change in favour of us little guys, I am optimistic it will. But never again, will we see such blatant manipulation in the market, the inaction of regulatory bodies, or a chance like this again.

&#x200B;

# ""How does this smooth brained ape sell at the tippy top?""

&#x200B;

Short Answer: YOU DON'T

Longer Answer: In theory, ""The Way"" will be to let a small portion of shares go at a time, never dump your full load in one go. People have spoken about TA and reading the graphs to know when this will start and end. It likely won't work .. so you're best off doing something like:

&#x200B;

# Billy Holds 42 🍌 (Risk Free bananas, the sweetest kind)

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 1k

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 2k

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 4k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 8k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 16k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 32k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 64k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 128k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 256k

... You get Billys point.  


\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\* - Billy is kinda pissed at the FUD and that blatant MSM cuck up the other day reporting early on a dump. So... Given the fact that GME Ownership is around 300% of float.. (With Retail unknown.. but I would imagine very high) We have \*NEW\* figures to potentially ""cover"" at.. See below for Billys revised listing:

&#x200B;

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 100k

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 200k

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 400k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 800k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 1.6m

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 3.2m

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 6.4m

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 12.8m

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 25.6m

&#x200B;

And at this stage, Billy has made .. **\~ $511,000** profit from a $7500 outlay (which was already covered) and only used 9 🍌 ... Billy \*STILL\* has 33 🍌 left.... That's a fkn lot.

&#x200B;

Billy hasn't dumped 42 🍌 @ 1 price, and watched it climb and felt like he missed out, he also didn't greatly affect the other apes as he did this.

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 2k

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 4k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 8k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 16k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 32k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 64k

... You get Billys point.  


\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\* - Billy is kinda pissed at the FUD and that blatant MSM cuck up the other day reporting early on a dump. So... Given the fact that GME Ownership is around 300% of float.. (With Retail unknown.. but I would imagine very high) We have \*NEW\* figures to potentially ""cover"" at.. See below for Billys revised listing:

&#x200B;

And at this stage, Billy has made .. **\~ $511,000** profit from a $7500 outlay (which was already covered) and only used 9 🍌 ... Billy \*STILL\* has 33 🍌 left.... That's a fkn lot.

&#x200B;

Billy hasn't dumped 42 🍌 @ 1 price, and watched it climb and felt like he missed out, he also didn't greatly affect the other apes as he did this.

&#x200B;

Billy is again a smart 🦍

&#x200B;

When you have 0 risk, and a solid idea in your smooth brain how you're going to play this...

&#x200B;

Just enjoy the ride. You earned it 🦍

&#x200B;

Also, when this hits 100k a share I'll be getting my first ever tattoo... You can bet your 🍌 on that.

&#x200B;

Thank you for your time.

&#x200B;

I like the stock.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Cover initial investment for small portion of 🍌 at unspecified amounts/times - retain rest and let go 1 🍌 at a fkn time. Simple. Not advice. Just common ape sense.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you for the awards!! - Honestly (and it gets said a lot), please save them, buy a loved one a share! Spread the word and the 🍌 - More apes = more tendies. But thank you!

&#x200B;

Okay, so I've been here since early January.

I've watched since a few days before the first spike, I invested because I like the stock, and I invested high at the time \~$300 a share.

I watched GME climb, I watched the switch get flipped and I watched it fall to discounted rates. I bought more. I bought more recently, knowing the war was not yet over. We had won, but they had yet to admit defeat. I held, I bought the dip, the cycle repeated.

A lot of us did.

I've been here, reading every post in ""Hot"" first, then every post in ""New"" after, then every post in ""Controversial"" after that.. Then jumping sub Reddits to see what's going on with WSB (and if I'm feeling cheeky GME\_Meltdown lol) .. The point is, in terms of GME alone, I've read a \*LOT\*.

This topic today is something I've seen people touch on, but in reality is the one defining principle you apes all need to remember going forward.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# ""0 Risk = 0 Fucks."" - The method to attaining true 💎🙌

[We will still have YOLOs, people who have plenty of disposable income, and just smooth brained apes. But hear me out.](https://preview.redd.it/0qhnzm2rm5m61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aedb83543448c586fc3415ffe4c0c991f6bd16e4)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Let me paint a picture of why this is important.*

&#x200B;

Let's say Billy the Ape works a middle class job, earns say 50k a year.. supports a family, has debts, and is average in the financial sense. (Giant 💎 nuts though)

Billy sees what's happening and scrapes together life savings, using all of his available cash to get as many 🍌 🍌 🍌 as Billy can afford.

Now, imagine Billy being here in January when the first spray of ape shit hit the fan and he loses upwards of 80% of his 🍌..

Being the ""predatory"" 🦍 Billy is, he HODLs strong.. and in fact uses what he can from his pay to even average down his position and buy more 🍌 🍌 . Smart Ape.

Still.... at the back of his mind, the mountains of FUD, and the potential unknown risks involved in interstellar 🚀 travel still exist.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**It does in every ape. This is normal.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How does one successfully remove all of this risk? ->! I will tell you. Soon Ape. Keep reading. Good ape.!<

&#x200B;

[Your Ape family - be it your immediate family, others around you who you support.. \*AND\* each of you here.](https://preview.redd.it/r3qxmmbum5m61.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=114542bfd9691be40edcc93e5f18397d360b5c2e)

&#x200B;

Each ape is an individual, each ape has their own family of apes to provide for. But each ape also trusts other apes in this whole saga.. with good reason. We have proven our staunch support, we like the stock. And every sign we see (confirmation bias or not) leads us to believe our DD, and that of others is spot on. So what comes next?

&#x200B;

# The BIGGEST test of 💎🙌 comes at 10k, 100k, 500k .. $1mil+

&#x200B;

*It's easy to hold when you have nothing left to lose - (Sitting at -80% in the red, ""Fuck them, I ain't leaving!)*

&#x200B;

*It's easy to hold when you've broke even - (Only up from here right?)*

&#x200B;

*It's easy to hold when you're double your money - (Look at me guys, I'm a mini-DFV, to the moon!!* 🚀🚀🚀)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# It's NOT going to be easy to hold at 10x or 20x or 100x your investment.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[How you WILL feel holding all those unrealised tendies.](https://preview.redd.it/lkdpir0xm5m61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc890a0d7215309daa5d8d6a7e31f1ea21af4de9)

&#x200B;

Essentially, each ape that hasn't been exposed to this kind of cash before, will be Atlas, you must be ready to shoulder the weight of the world as it if it depends on you.

There are already posts about what people will do, how they are calculating their earnings from holding etc. This is great, and apes are excited which they should be.

But, when the price continues to roll higher, and Apes start seeing chunks of money they've never once held in their accounts before, they will consider 📄🙌 and taking their ""win"" and going quite and spitefully watching as the show goes on.

&#x200B;

# Do not be that ape.

&#x200B;

With that being said..... The one true tactic to forming those diamond hands we all talk about is:

&#x200B;

# COVER YOUR INITIAL FUCKING INVESTMENT! 💎🙌

&#x200B;

It's really that simple.

&#x200B;

I am \*NOT\* telling you to give up your 🍌's --- This is the \*REASON\* this is happening. I'm not going into the DD, but you know the situation with the shorts and there's posts even as recent as \*TODAY\* suggesting that they just keep digging deeper.

&#x200B;

This is fkn mint for apes.

&#x200B;

But, there will come a price point - Where you can recoup your initial investment for relatively few 🍌.

&#x200B;

Before you shout ""REEEEE SHILL"" --- No, I will hold a share or two until the very end and most likely find some way to print it and put it on a wall in my girlfriends boyfriends mansion.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**But.. Here's an example:**

&#x200B;

Billy the Ape buy 50 🍌 @ 150 = $7500

Billy HODLS 🍌 - Price Rises.

🍌 rises to $1k - Billy releases 8 Bananas.

(EDIT:  Hypothetically Billy could also do this - **🍌 rises to $9001 (over 9000) - Billy releases 1 singular banana and covers all his initial cost and takes the wife and her boyfriend out for expensive McDonalds.. leaving 49 🍌 for fuck you money**)

&#x200B;

Billy retains 42 🍌 **- AT ZERO FUCKING COST. ZERO. BILLY NOW HAS HIS CASH AND 42 FUCKING BANANAS**

&#x200B;

Billy waits patiently, even buys some more 🍌if there's a dip (spoiler alert, there will be) - But in general Billy sits and watches his FREE money, make MORE free money!

&#x200B;

Billy is a smart 🦍

&#x200B;

(This is also down to personal circumstances - Only your ape brain knows how bigger risk you took on this, so adjust the example and cover price accordingly - Not advice. Fact.)

And now..

# Billy no longer has any RISK, or any FEAR of losing what was already his.

&#x200B;

# This empowers Billy.

&#x200B;

[BILLY CAN'T LOSE NOW, ONLY WIN, QUESTION IS \\""WIN HOW MUCH?\\"" 💎🙌](https://preview.redd.it/llwytxlzm5m61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d65d718cd902554ca26423734f66e971cd371a67)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chew a few more crayons, take a break, come back. There's more to this. I'll wait.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now my brother, who I recently told about GME, laughed at me. Thought I was wearing a tin foil hat. In fact a few people did.

They have all got their own 🍌 🍌 🍌 🍌 now. Some got a lot, others got 1 🍌 - It all counts.

If you can't talk the DD to people, share the Reddit, or even just some of the epic posts that have been done.

Media is going to report on this less and less as we climb until they can't ignore it.

You're \*IN\* the ape camp, you see each others ideas and DD on the daily.

95% of the population still don't... or if they did, decided they don't want to know.

Share the ideas with those you know, who stand to benefit from it. @$250 it's still a bargain.

Papa Cohen will knock this out of the park. Trust.

&#x200B;

[Yep. This dude. Fkn great for us apes, and the A-Team he brought with him! ](https://preview.redd.it/2dvn1t27n5m61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3161a08d422070f3ffbf455ba7ff400d86336fc)

&#x200B;

# Flash forward a few weeks or months...

# (Well.. it could still be sooner, but let's pace ourselves. Don't $CUM too soon! More apes will want in on this orgy.)

&#x200B;

Stonk is up, volume is miniscule, and we are jumping not by $1 or $2 in a movement, but $10's and $100's in a movement.

This \*WILL\* happen.. when the squeeze begins it will move at a pace you will struggle to comprehend with your smooth brains. This is good. It means it's beginning. Read the DD's - The squeeze will not be squoze in a day. But you WILL know when it starts.

&#x200B;

# Part 2: The End Game.

This part comes later... could be weeks, could be months. Do not limit yourself by time. You have now set yourself in a position where there is only profit, no risk. Do not look at the money going up and consider it a risk.

You never had these 🍌🍌 before all this, and this will be the one and only 🚀🚀🚀🚀 fkn moonshot you will get. With the world watching, the new rules to be imposed, and the serious boning that some of these HFs (Hi Melvin) are getting from Game Stop..

&#x200B;

**Shit will change.**

&#x200B;

Now it may change in favour of us little guys, I am optimistic it will. But never again, will we see such blatant manipulation in the market, the inaction of regulatory bodies, or a chance like this again.

&#x200B;

# ""How does this smooth brained ape sell at the tippy top?""

&#x200B;

Short Answer: YOU DON'T

Longer Answer: In theory, ""The Way"" will be to let a small portion of shares go at a time, never dump your full load in one go. People have spoken about TA and reading the graphs to know when this will start and end. It likely won't work .. so you're best off doing something like:

Now my brother, who I recently told about GME, laughed at me. Thought I was wearing a tin foil hat. In fact a few people did.

They have all got their own 🍌 🍌 🍌 🍌 now. Some got a lot, others got 1 🍌 - It all counts.

If you can't talk the DD to people, share the Reddit, or even just some of the epic posts that have been done.

Media is going to report on this less and less as we climb until they can't ignore it.

You're \*IN\* the ape camp, you see each others ideas and DD on the daily.

95% of the population still don't... or if they did, decided they don't want to know.

Share the ideas with those you know, who stand to benefit from it. @$250 it's still a bargain.

Stonk is up, volume is miniscule, and we are jumping not by $1 or $2 in a movement, but $10's and $100's in a movement.

This \*WILL\* happen.. when the squeeze begins it will move at a pace you will struggle to comprehend with your smooth brains. This is good. It means it's beginning. Read the DD's - The squeeze will not be squoze in a day. But you WILL know when it starts.

&#x200B;

# Part 2: The End Game.

This part comes later... could be weeks, could be months. Do not limit yourself by time. You have now set yourself in a position where there is only profit, no risk. Do not look at the money going up and consider it a risk.

You never had these 🍌🍌 before all this, and this will be the one and only 🚀🚀🚀🚀 fkn moonshot you will get. With the world watching, the new rules to be imposed, and the serious boning that some of these HFs (Hi Melvin) are getting from Game Stop..

Now it may change in favour of us little guys, I am optimistic it will. But never again, will we see such blatant manipulation in the market, the inaction of regulatory bodies, or a chance like this again.

Short Answer: YOU DON'T

Longer Answer: In theory, ""The Way"" will be to let a small portion of shares go at a time, never dump your full load in one go. People have spoken about TA and reading the graphs to know when this will start and end. It likely won't work .. so you're best off doing something like:

ALOT,"This is a continuation of a DDDD I wrote a few weeks ago about [how GME could cause a stock market crash](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/) through mass de-grossing from short/long Hedge Funds. However, that was just one side of the story, and there was an even more troubling 2008-style flaw in the system the GME has revealed in our financial system; something that first interested me when Thomas Peterffy, the founder and chairman of Interactive Brokers mentioned it on CNBC.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

First, let’s go on a history lesson about the 2008 Financial Crisis and one of the main factors in it - Counterparty Risk.

# What is Counterparty Risk?

Counterparty Risk is the likelihood that the counterparty (i.e. entity on the other side) of the transaction might default on an obligation. To put it simply, imagine Bob sells Alice one GME call with a $10 strike price. Unfortunately for Bob, some 🦍🦍🦍 in an obscure subreddit sent GME 🚀🌝 so when those calls expire, GME is at $410, meaning Bob now owes Alice $40K. However, Bob’s entire portfolio is worth only $10K and is unable to fulfil his financial obligation when he wrote those GME calls, defaulting on it.

# Counterparty Risk in 2008 & the “Solution”

This is exactly what happened in the 2008 Financial Crisis when AIG sold Credit Default Swaps (basically, puts on the housing market) and defaulted on their financial obligations when the housing market collapsed. It made everything worse, because other funds were using these CDS to hedge their own positions in the housing market, so when those CDS turned out to be worthless because the other side was bankrupt, it endangered the financial soundness of firms like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BoA and Marril Lynch who bought these swaps. This suddenly created a counterparty risk to anyone on the other sides of all the trades they have made, and has a domino effect that ends up with basically every financial institution collapsing if AIG collapses; in other words, AIG was too big to fail.

Title 7 of Dodd Frank, which was the law passed by Congress as a response to the Financial Crisis to prevent this from ever happening again, mandates that all securities and derivatives be cleared in clearing houses such as DTCC and post collateral they deem to be sufficient to manage counterparty risk to them. These clearing houses would then be responsible for ensuring a transaction is fulfilled on both sides, and if one of the parties in the transactions fail to meet their obligation, they are responsible for honoring it.

# Why this doesn’t really work

What this solution has effectively created is one monolithic central counterparty in the form of the DTCC. According to their [2019 annual report](https://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2019/financial-performance/), they processed $2.15 quadrillion worth of securities in 2019, or 24 times the global GDP of $24T and 6 times the total net worth of the world of $360T. Basically, they’re way too big to fail. So to make sure this never happens, they have pretty broad authority to unilaterally decide how much collateral each participant based on their outstanding trades using an unknown and obscure formula.

This is how Robinhood got fucked over by them - their collateral requirements for the DTCC suddenly increased ten-fold on them, and they had a liquidity crisis (which they tried really hard not to admit, because this is the brokerage equivalent of your bank saying they're running out of cash and you might not get your deposits back) because they didn’t have enough cash to cover it. What happens if a participant can’t meet their collateral requirements? Similar to a degenerate options gambler who can’t meet their margin call (aka your average [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) 🦍), their entire portfolio gets liquidated.

See, DTCC not only is a central clearing house that guarantees most settlements; technically that’s the NSCC, which is a subsidiary / service provided by the DTCC. Their main operations are the equivalent of a central bank for brokerages - the broker of brokers, responsible for holding the physical shares that the brokerages own; hence their name Depository Trust Clearing Corporation.

So what does it take to bring the DTCC down? Most recently, GME. For those who haven’t seen it yet, this interview with the Chairman of Interactive Brokers (apparently post gets auto-deleted if I put a YouTube link, but should be easy to find) on why they halted buying of GME outlines the issue pretty clearly. For those with too short of an attention span to click the link, he basically says

* The most important reason why he halted GME purchases was to protect the integrity of the financial system and clearing houses
* There were ALOT of options that suddenly became in the money, and whoever held them suddenly were owed a bucket of tendies; he mentioned $10-15B losses in one expiry date alone.
* These tendies need to come from somewhere. Anyone who was net short GME got absolutely fucked and might defaulting on their short position or call option write.
* If they default, the broker is on the hook to pay out those losses. If the broker cannot pay for it, they go under and clearing house (DTCC) is on the hook

# Tin Foil Hat Time

Now here’s where I’ll start speculating on what exactly happened on the other side of the trade and DTCC. So, who’s on the other side of all these GME calls, or in other words, who wrote all these calls and suddenly owes fuck ton of money when GME 🚀🌝? Probably Citadel, which is involved in [over 99% of all options trading volume](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/products/equities-and-options/). Now in theory, Market Makers are not in the business of taking a position and should be delta-neutral in all positions they take.

However, delta and gamma hedging is a tricky art and probably not possible to perfect, especially in situations where a ticker suddenly becomes irrationally volatile, has large gaps between sessions (i.e. the opening price is significantly above or below the previous closing) and when the underlying is illiquid relative to the notional exposure value. I’m too lazy to actually research this data, although I’m almost certain this is true (someone pls fact check me), but it’s extremely likely that at a certain point, the amount of shares Citadel needed to buy to remain fully delta hedged on all the options they wrote exceeded the available float, and became literally impossible to do.

This is because a large portion of the options they wrote were out-of-the-money, meaning that although they don’t need to buy a lot of GME shares when they first sell the contract to be delta-hedged, they would need to drastically purchase more and more shares if GME goes up, causing it to go up even more and becoming a vicious cycle (i.e. gamma squeeze). Usually, market makers might use other strategies like buying similar tickers or ETFs holding GME to try to remain delta neutral, but there’s so much volatility that it’s possible that Citadel was in fact net delta-negative on GME - on in other words, they lost money if GME goes up.

Okay, so let’s make a logical jump (with no evidence) to speculate an idea - what if **Citadel’s financial soundness came into question?** In other words, what if they were at risk of bankruptcy and ended up defaulting on their financial obligations? Well, they’re involved with over 99% of all options trades, and if they default then the DTCC is suddenly on the hook for unwinding their massive portfolio and ensuring that all of Citadel’s financial obligations, including paying out all those GME calls, are met.

Obviously, DTCC does not want this to happen, and as a private corporation, they are allowed to do whatever is in their best financial interest to preserve their own financial soundness to ensure their business is not at risk that is allowed within the financial regulatory framework they operate in - including raising GME margin requirements.

*TLDR; DTCC is definitely too big to fail, so they get broad sweeping powers by financial regulation to make sure they don't fail. Citadel is probably too big to fail in DTCC's eyes because they don't want to be responsible for honoring 99% of all options transactions.*",The Systematic Risk in the Financial System GME revealed,m1jksq,117,383,0.95,383,0,,Discussion,False,True,1

REAL," 

Everything just came together in a glorious trainwreck in my retarded ape brain.

Ive been seeing these bots on Webull holding up these sell walls starting .02 cents above market value and moving up a penny at a time to about .08 cents above market. So These orders move and stay in the same position above market value no matter what the price or how fast it moves. I have seen that every so often one of these sells go through. FUCKING LAG!

So if im right about this, this means Hedgie is accumulating shares here and there. I have seen this in other markets im able to watch closely although webull is where im watching the most since its where im trading.

I have also seen some extremely large buy orders go through that my gut tells me are Hedgie buys. 10-20k shares at a time.

So what I am getting at here is that Ive seen things all over the market that suggest to me that Hedgie short seller is actually buying shares right now, but its not enough to come close to covering their shorts. So what would Hedgie want to do with these stacks of shares?

Well earnings report are tomorrow. Now I dont know what time the info is going to be released. But what I expect is Hedgie is going to let the market go at open tomorrow, and where ever we move the price we move the price. So that their is hype, then when earnings come out they are going to dump as hard as they can and drop that price with a dive that looks like a crash. First off it wont crash, If they had they selling power to crash it they would crash it to cover their shorts right? But its going to dip very hard and fast. The 1m chart is going to shake every paper handed retard around. and cause a further dip.

IF THIS GOES DOWN LIKE THIS (because this is just a thought)

BUT IF IT GOES DOWN LIKE THIS LISTEN UP!

This will be the moment of truth. YOU MUST REMAIN RESLIENT If #DiamondsHands is just a hash tag to you, you will probably be out when this happens and probably at a loss too. ITS NOT A LOSS IF YOU HOLD. Our best move if this goes down, is to double down and #BuyTheDip like you have never bought the fucking dip before. My gut is telling me 7.50ish low, possible 6.50 depending on how many paper hands been front like diamond hands.

If you get shook at this point this was all for naught. This will be a last ditch effort for them to win this war. If you sell you could drop the price low enough for hedgie to start buying back short positions. That would be disastrous. YOU CANNOT FUCKING SELL HERE. If this is going to shake you please get out before the announcement, take your profits and run. Its 11.60 as I write this. Take a sweet profit and let us hold those shares for you.

Again if this goes down. REAL investors are going to see AMC's earnings and if the loss isnt terrible it will attract organic investors getting ready to make some money off this squeeze and long term off reopenings. So long as earnings are at less of a loss than Q2 & Q3 We will be good. This is expected. The real activity that will come behind the announcements will boost the price up. This whole thing could play out in 30 min to an hour, or over the course of a few hours.

Real Diamond Hands players will understand this, real investors are going to see through this bullshit, THIS IS MEANT TO SHAKE YOU, yeah you reading this and those apes who dont. Our only play to beat this is to hold that shit like youve never held before. You are on the outside of the rocket hanging on to handle bars breaking the atmosphere at this point, what you are feeling is the last bit of resistance. Secondary play is to when this dip happens to buy as much as you fucking can, this our chance to make our position infinitely stronger by doubling down on their last ditch effort.

I have planed to set a buy for 100 more shares in the 7.60 cent range.

If im right im right, if im wrong i dont need more shares than I already have to change my life in the short squeeze. But the take away is dont get shook if this scenario plays out or anything similar.

One thing im certain of is you can expect negative press about the earnings no matter what they actually are. and you can expect the bot swarm to push that negative press all over the place. be ready to combat this and educate people about why amc is not going to report a profit.

Anyway If you stuck through my retarded ramblings I hope this helps you better prepare for a possible negative price reaction to the earnings report. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, just the ramblings of a retarded coin investor who got attracted to this whole thing smelling hedgie blood in the water like a shark. I just wanted to drink their tears and laugh never expected to make money. Now that this is playing out I see we have a potential here like there has never been before. If you did find my retarded ramblings insightful you can catch more retarded market analysis on twitter @ [Crypt0\_Killa](https://twitter.com/Crypt0_Killa)

I am certainly interested to hear feedback on others thoughts about this. Thanks and God Speed Apes",Possible last ditch play scenario from hedgie on $AMC with earnings report,m1hvz2,58,152,0.91,152,0,,Discussion,False,True,-1

LIFE,"Here is a load of non-advice horseshit from an idiot who knows nothing, but has been watching RBLX and just read an Investopedia Article on Direct Listings:

A lot of people seem concerned about where RBLX's opening price will be pinned. This is the wrong question. RBLX is doing a Direct Listing; all existing shares become tradeable by whomever holds them, subject to some restrictions. Essentially, employees and VC's get their first chance to cash out.

The price will therefore be dependent upon market forces rather than any particular price target set by an underwriter. Unlike an IPO, there is no underwriter here. It can't ""open"" until a bid-ask has been filled.

RBLX's price action therefore depends on the incentives of insiders currently holding the stock tonight, on RBLX Eve. More sophisticated VCs and investors might want to hold some if they see a heavy price target. **VCs** might also want to do some profit taking - they've already made a ton on RBLX and would probably want to diversify.

**Employees** have been working around the clock for however many years (at least four, if they want to achieve total vesting of all their equity). In my view, many would have no interest in holding RBLX for value - they would likely want to cash in their chips. Their shares were literally worthless to them until RBLX went public, so in a way, $45 is as good as $100 - they hold thousands and thousands of shares, and are about to become very rich after working tons of hours. Even if it dips, you might see more sales from employees who are like: ""EFFIT I GAVE MY LIFE TO THESE TINY BLOCKPEOPLE SHITBAGS I MUST HAVE MY TENDIES"". When your shares were essentially free, $35 is appealing, particularly if price is dropping.

A selloff shouldn't be unexpected. Of course, aggressive meme-buying is also to be expected. But which side holds more weight?

In my view, the profit-taking motive will be stronger at the beginning; eventually, retail memes will win out. I am HEAVY bullish on RBLX longterm, and want to own as many shares as I can. But in the first hour or two, expect wide bid-asks, low liquidity, and maybe even a decent dip.

I of course, expect nothing but 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 in the longterm. But if you want to open your position in tendietown, it's good to think about entries.

**TL;DR:** 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 LONGTERM but expect swings and lots of opportunities to build positions; but just in case, I'm going to use 25% of my RBLX fund immediately at open when everyone is skittish.

**TL;DR II**: 🌈🐻 in the early RBLX history, eventual 🚀. Cannot gauge when anything will happen, not advice, you have no idea whether i eat my own feces.

&#x200B;

3/13/2021 EDIT: for those still following, it appears this was HALF right.  The volume in the first 2 hours was very high, as retail and others simply wanted to be part of RBLX.  Since open, it's been extremely low volume.  Absent a catalyst, I'd expect it to drip downwards on low volume over the coming months - will be plenty of opportunities to enter.  I'll probably be selling $55 puts once I get a better sense of this.

LIFE,"Hey Guys, 

I went full retard and thought to myself, hey GME plans to become Amazon of electronics right? So why don't we compare these two when it comes to market caps and their share values.

I might have went full autistic and I used Amazon's Market cap and online electronics' sales as values that are correlated.

MKT CAP: 1.54 T, 

Total Rev: 125.56 B

55.1% Of revenue is Electronics = 69.18 B

Amazon's share value is rounded to $3000, # of shares is 503,000,000

GME $250, # of shares 69,750,000

Assumptions:

GME will steal - 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 100% of that business. This is ignoring all of the other things that either of the businesses have going on for them.

55.1% of 1.54T = $848.54B (Market cap value)

25% = $212.135B (Market cap value)

50% = $424.27B (Market cap value)

75% = $636.405B (Market cap value)

90% = $736.686B (Market cap value)

100% = $848.54B (Market cap value)

Add current GME's Market cap of 15.53 B to each.

Adjusted GME Share value when they steal amazon's % of electronic revenue with those Market Cap Values:

25% = $3,264.01 per share

50% = $6,305.38 per share

75% = $9,346.74 per share

90% = $11,171.56 per share

100% = $12,388.10 per share

SO WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU SELL FOR LESS? THESE ARE NOT EVEN SQUEEZE VALUES. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS, A BIT RETARDED, AND HOLDING FOR MY LIFE. 

GODSPEED.

HAS,"As title says. Robinhood literally never executes my options without a massive wait. I just was day trading some BAC options and I’ve run into two problems.

1. They lying:
Idk if anyone has run into this issue and as retarded I may be I wouldn’t do it twice. Both times I was day trading BAC. Essentially I go to double down and instead of buying more it executed a sell and closes my positions or when I go to exit my position it would make me buy more instead of closing the position. I could be retarded here but I wanna know if it’s me that’s the problem or if it’s robinhood doing some fuckery. So have y’all had a similar issue?

2. They won’t execute my orders:
I’ve had now several problems where BAC locks me out of profit by not letting me execute orders. Now I trade stuff that’s LIQUID AF aka BAC. The contract I was trading had nearly 6k OI and 13k in volume. It’s the $26 March 12 put. I had my order sat at $29 for nearly two minutes and it didn’t execute while the price indicated $29 for the put during the whole 2minutes. That may not sound like a lot but it is if ur day trading. Long story short BAC reverse and I ended up selling for a massive loss compared to unrealized gain. I also got cucked on RKT since I bought debit spreads and robinhood refused to let me sell them. The stock went up 70% but robinhood didn’t let me sell them for 20% gain and my spreads were ITM deep and liquid.

Edit: I remembers I had more dirt on robinhood

3. They openly steal:
So I notice this whenever I day trade options and currently I can see it in my portfolio as clear as day. They will tell you “we sold your contract for $25” and you bought at $24 so why the fuck is there less than $1 gain in my portfolio. Big money might not notice this but they literally steal in pennies from your options order. Tell me you executed at 24.98 if u want to steal those two pennies and don’t lie to me. This one HAS to be illegal unless they have some fine print covering it cuz as far as I know options are only traded in dollars and not pennies so why are two pennies being stolen when is supposed to be “FrEe TrAding”

I’m looking for a broker that’s free or has reasonable fee’s for options trading with a friendly interface. I don’t care for charts since I use trading view and coin flips. 

I need four things:
1. Buy button
2. Sell button

AAPL,"$AAPL has been my 2nd largest earning stock in the past 12 months only dethroned by a quick stint with $GME. I closed all of my positions with $AAPL while the market was in decline and now I'm going to be going back in full force.  


The first major item here is the news that there may be a virtual event on March 23rd (this is why I'll be looking at picking up some March 26th expiration calls that are close to ATM).

&#x200B;

1. Rumor of an [Apple](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/08/apple-event-march-23-kang/) even on March 23rd, some items that may be coming:
   1. [AirTags](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/) \- not that exciting, just their version of Tile
   2. [AirPods](https://9to5mac.com/2020/01/15/60-million-airpods-sold-in-2019/) \- Apple has sold 60 million of these in 2019....that's 71% of true wireless headphone revenue
   3. Potential for new Mac / iPad updates. The iMac Pro has been discontinued so it's possible they make an announcement around a Mac product here.

Company Fundamentals:

* From the above you'll see they have a commanding share of the true wireless headphone market. Any additional updates to the AirPods would be a great revenue generator. As much as people roasted the over the ear AirPods max...they're sold out everywhere and people were paying 2x the price to get them off eBay.
* Looking below there is a steady increase in revenue from the iPad, Mac...and significant growth from ""other"" which would be your AirPods, and other accessories.

For those of you who understand how the 10yr relates to equity markets and how inflation = bad news for Apple...It's trading at an attractive P/E right now compared to other companies. It has a lower P/E than Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, Adobe etc.

https://preview.redd.it/cfh8d1qw32m61.png?width=2846&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3a0c4692e6c980db9f6d851249503bb4e14cd4e

They had their best earnings report ever last quarter, and the stock dropped after, and continued to do so from $140's down to a low of $116 yesterday.

https://preview.redd.it/luqayw4542m61.png?width=2868&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba18996c8eb51f94f5649c3eefe7da40e149d3e0

Apple is below it's price it entered 2021 at, which to me flashes a huge buy sign as this is oversold. While tech might not have growth like it did in 2021, and just because $AAPL has mountains of cash, I don't think any pending inflation fears should sway anyone away from thinking this is as blue chip as you can get.

AMD,"Hey All - Here are my main thoughts as to why I have such a overwhelming part of my portfolio in AMD.

Feel free to disagree, agree or critique. WSB seems mostly bullish on AMD but we don't need an echo chamber!

Bullish:
- Zen has been a hit and the road map into Zen 4 looks to keep kicking Intel while it's down.
- Recent offerings from the Radeon group have been increasingly more competitive, even rivaling Nvidia's core business on a fraction of Nvidia's R+D budget.
- Zen 3 continues to show excellence in incorporating Chiplet technology. Chiplet technology allows for greater yields at the foundary, product flexibility and lower costs.
- This experience should transfer to Chiplet GPU technology - allowing for the Radeon group to perhaps take a measurable lead on Nvidia for a generation or two while they catch up.
- Epyc Milan looks dynamite and AMD will be able to gain market share in the computer server market. Recent hires in this area will help AMD gain more adoption.
- New chiplet CNDA data center GPU's on the horizon.
- New software stack incoming to compete with Nvidia's DLSS. This upscaling is rumored to provide a 2x performance boost and will be integrated into each games engine. Adoption by game companies is almost guaranteed since both consoles use and are set up to use the same technology.
- Business world views Lisa Su and AMD as ""execution machines"" - Moore's Law is Dead video. Product roadmaps and goals have consistently met and goals beaten expectations.
- Extensive business relationships with Microsoft and Sony.
- Mass OEM adoption seems to be happening in both Laptop and Desktop market.
- Xilinx merger adds massive revenue and capabilities.
- Because Lisa Su.

Bearish:
- Capacity issues at TSMC have restricted profits at times.
- They are competing with 2 monster companies in Intel and Nvidia in their core business areas.
- Semiconductor stocks are volatile by nature.
- Post Pandemic conditions might reduce profit margins.

That being said I'm confident the Bullish thesis is much more powerful than the Bearish one.

Please feel free to reply with any other bullish or bearish arguments. The more we can discuss the better informed everyone is.

ACAD,"Posting what might be a good options opportunity. Pharmaceutical company $ACAD went from $45/share to $24/share between close and open today. [The reason for this is the FDA has found postmarket and labeling deficiencies in their application for pimavanserin](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/acadia-analysts-cut-targets-as-fda-sees-application-deficiencies/ar-BB1epjWt). The company has until 4/3 to correct the issue.

That said, I believe the overcorrection today was massive. Even without this new drug on the market, the company still has Nuplazid for Parkinson's in it's portfolio and 2019 revenue of $339 million. Their average share price over the past 5 years is $32.63 .

The following price target changes were made in light of this news.  However, the stock has *immediately* pulled below even the least optimistic target.

* Stifel - DOWNGRADE from $68 to $27
* Jefferies - DOWNGRADE from $62 to $40
* Cantor - DOWNGRADE from $70 to $45

I see a lot of opportunity to make money with calls beyond April, where the position of the company will be more clear. If the deficiency is corrected prior to 4/3, the stock is almost guaranteed to go above $40 again. Since the nature of the deficiency is not yet disclosed, it could be something easily remedied.  Even if not, The current market price has overcorrected. A safe bet would be to balance long calls with April puts.

Example: June 18 $25c @$4.25 has a break even point of $29.25 at expiry.  Should the deficiency be corrected prior to April 3rd, this option has a 170% upside.

Not financial advice. Just a retard making an observation.

FSLR,"Wanted to provide some DD on a company that I feel has potential, $FSLR (First Solar).

I noticed this company after I received an alert about unusual options activity:

>$FSLR 5/21/2021 $70  
Type: CALLS  
Order: 926 @ 10.94  
Premium: $1,012,806  
Underlying: $76.55  
Daily Volume: 943  
OI: 46

Someone is clearly making a big bet that this company is going to be on the rise over the coming months. This company wasn't on my radar before, so after digging and research, I placed a similar call order. There has been a significant dip over the past few and I believe this is a good buy-in point for a few reasons outlined below.

**Price target:** $88.36 ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSLR/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSLR/))

**What they do:**

First Solar designs, develops, manufactures and markets a line of thin-film semiconductor photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules that convert sunlight into electricity.

**Analyst's Investment Thesis:**

>We believe that First Solar is well positioned for future growth based on its solid balance sheet and focus on cadmium telluride technology, which should provide a cost advantage relative to more commoditized technologies like polysilicon.  The company is also benefiting from an expanding opportunity set of utility-scale projects. First Solar's balance sheet is clean and it has a solid book of contracted projects heading into the next few years. First Solar could also be an attractive acquisition target for an integrated oil company looking to bolster its renewable operations. We caution, however, that FSLR shares have a history of volatility, and that any sales or earnings disappointment could result in a sharp selloff. As such, we view FSLR as appropriate only for risk-tolerant investors as part of a diversified portfolio.

Solar is a growing industry, so placing a bet on any front-runner in this space isn't a bad play.

SV,"So my ~~colleague~~ wifes boyfriend, who has no reddit account and wishes to have no association with you autists, has been doing some maths (or ""math"" for you americans, or ""fun hobby time"" for our chinese autists) in an attempt to back solve Short interest, using short volume & trading volume. The base idea behind his findings was that any short volume over 50% cannot be 100% covered that day... so he just thought - how much can these short boys actually cover, if all shorts opened were intended to be covered...

Here's what he's worked out spoiler alert:>!shorts r more fuk than bears!<

""So, I have been freaking the fuck out about this.  I am of the belief that at one point, FINRA said the truth about SI%... Being 226% on the 15th of january.  I had thought it was impossible to figure out what it was now, but then I started digging into the Short Volume.

At first, I had thought that it would be interesting if we could see how much they could have covered if 100% of long volume transfers went to covering shorts (Short Overflow)...

So then, I got a thought... let me manually import the short volume data since the 15th and see where this could go.

So from the FINRA report I got:

* Short Volume
* Short Exempt Volume
* Exchanged Volume (Long Volume + Short Volume)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qvqwl2rw31m61.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fb1fbc9c5fbb7971d179d9f982ad75d54287d63

From Yahoo Historical Data I got:

* Total Trade Volume
* Day's Closing
* Day's low

Then I calculated this: Total Short Volume (SV + SEV)

* Long Volume (ExV - SV)
* SV% (TSV / EV)
* Off Exchange Volume (TV - EV)
* Short Overflow (TSV - LV)

I realized that this all cost them a fuck ton.

So I said:  If they covered through calls, then they as an extreme minimum paid 40$/share for them AND only would do so when GME was on the way up as it would be a waste of money otherwise. Thus I made MinimalCost of OFF-Exchange as (OEV \* $40).

If they covered through Long Volume on market, then we'd be able to estimate that CONSERVATIVELY by comparing the days low to the Daily long volume (Day's Low \* LV).

Then came to the conclusion of the data:

I wrote down the FINVIZ float, the SI% from FINRA, and derived the Short Volume at the time. THEN, I made 3 tables:

* Table 1: Shows how many Shorts are there at different intervals of covering on Off-market and On-market.
* Table 2: Shows the cost of doing those coverings.
* Table 3: Shows the new SI%.

&#x200B;

IN CONCLUSION:   Using My data, I was able to derive that the **535.9% SI%** being passed around would cost Short Sellers 25 BILLION DOLLARS theoretically.

The **Maximum SI% can be rn is 942.06%.**

It is **litterally impossible for it to be under 200% rn** as it would be too costly.

I believe that SI% is over 600%, as I believe that certain companies ran while they could, spending 10 billion dollars AT MOST between them all for covering.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zyzechcy31m61.png?width=1275&format=png&auto=webp&s=e79ea03302ad64646162736f3f9a39843cc484fe

Because you cannot justify over 20% of long volume transfers being covering, its mostly algos and day traders as for calls, I just dont see that going over 30% as its abundantly clear calls are being used against them, not for them. and even that is pushing it.

My point for my want is this: I**t is impossible that SI% is not more than 226%** as was said on the 15th as the costs would be to great and the data is just not there to support it but instead I came to the conclusion that we are way fucking past that for simmilar reasons

&#x200B;

NOTE: NONE OF THIS EVEN TAKES INTEREST INTO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR COSTS, IT IS ALL JUST THEORETICAL COVERING COSTS ALONE. THE DATA DOES NOT SUPPORT THEM HAVING COVERED MUCH AT ALL, YOU TAKE FROM THIS WHAT YOU WILL. I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR DONT COME BITCHING.""

AMD,"**Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) is undervalued, well positioned against competition, and poised to take further market share in rapidly growing and high demand industries.**

AMD is mainly known for its presence in the gaming industry, and some of you may remember it as one of the OG WSB meme stocks. This subreddit has seen the potential of AMD multiple times in the past, and I believe the recent AMD dip has created an excellent opportunity.

**First, let's look at how AMD compares to some of its competition:**

* If you are into PC gaming at all, you will be aware of how CPU sentiment has shifted greatly away from INTC in favor of AMD.

* The main reasons AMD CPUs are becoming more and more preferable are because they offer significantly more bang for your buck versus Intel CPUs, INTC has recently had disappointing new product releases, even high budget PCs are often abandoning Intel entirely.
[CPU Comparison](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/high_end_cpus.html)

* AMD just released new GPUs last week, which are superior in performance and more affordable than many of NVDA's top of the line models. Even though they are still high in price, this shows that AMD is very able and willing to compete with NVDA's top of the line GPUs. They sold out initially within a couple hours of release.
[GPU Comparison](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html)

* AMD produces both the CPUs and GPUs in both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X. These consoles only just released a few months ago and will be in extremely high demand for the next 5 years or more.

NVDA Market Cap: $290B

INTC Market Cap: $245B

**AMD Market Cap: $89.5B**

Morningstar's research indicates that AMD's fundamental value is around $80 price per share. Meanwhile, they estimate NVDA's fundamental value to be around $330 price per share. Morningstar's estimates tend to be conservative, yet even after this correction that tech has endured, most tech companies remain well above their fundamental value - except AMD.

**As I am typing this, AMD is currently under $75 price per share. Even if AMD somehow had extremely minimal future growth (I will further outline why future growth will actually be astronomical), it would still fundamentally be valued at $80 per share AT LEAST, and that's with boomer estimates.**

I don't claim that NVDA or INTC are bad companies, rather I seek to point out that AMD is being underestimated by Wall Street. There's more than enough room for all of these companies to have a future in the gaming industry and adjacent industries.

[The gaming industry experienced record growth in 2020, and isn't stopping any time soon.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/videogames-are-a-bigger-industry-than-sports-and-movies-combined-thanks-to-the-pandemic-11608654990)

I see some claims that the end of lockdowns will mean less people playing video games or using computers, I don't think this claim is even worth seriously addressing. If you seriously think that you may be a little out of touch.

**Other Industries AMD Will Succeed In**

While my primary focus has been on AMD's success in the gaming industry, their GPU's are also widely used for mining the digital currencies that cannot be named or discussed on this subreddit, but it is still worth mentioning that market and the large demand that it brings. We've also seen NVDA branch off into the autonomous driving and AI industries, AMD could easily do the same.

[AMD CEO, Lisa Su, has previously expressed interest in branching towards EV and AI industries, and says AMD's technology is already there. (This is the best link I can find at the moment)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/b4w1hm/is_amd_getting_more_serious_about_autonomous/)

**Semiconductor Shortage?**

Some people cite the recent semiconductor shortage as a reason to be bearish on AMD and related companies. While this is an issue, it is clearly short term, and I think these shortages have been more than priced in by now, especially for AMD. [Demand is extremely high, which is good, and AMD is working on increasing their capacity.](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/lisa-su-shortages-constrained-amd-s-record-2020-and-will-continue) Lisa Su says she expects shortages to ease the second half of 2021, adding that they will have added capacity in the second half of 2021.

The demand for AMD products is extremely high, this is clearly bullish in the long term. AMD’s technology will continue to be very valuable in many industries, the potential for growth here is still astronomical. Lisa Su is a great CEO who has brought AMD in a great and very competitive direction, and there are few CEOs better suited to successfully navigate any future speedbumps.

If that still doesn’t sooth your mind, [the Biden Administration has already committed to easing the shortage.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/biden-signs-executive-order-to-address-chip-shortage-through-a-supply-chain-review.html)

**Positions?**

I tried to keep this analysis relatively short and sweet. I believe I have made a compelling case to be bullish on AMD in the coming months/year. IV on $AMD calls at the moment is extremely low, historically low. As low as 45% on many, making this a great time to buy, shares are also a fantastic choice. I recommend you give yourself enough time in case AMD continues to dip along with the rest of tech, but YOLO to your heart’s content if you wish to do so.

$AMD $100c 7/16, $AMD $120c 01/21/22

TA,"#  Intro

Welcome, and I hope everyone is fresh for a new day of holding because things seem to be getting interesting now. My take on this DD is a bit different to my usual format as I've decided to focus on the Technical analysis side of GME this time around. Why? Because you apes couldn't contemplate words so now I'm using colourful crayons and pictures instead. As always, I've inserted a TLDR for the autists but I do recommend reading it since it'll also help grow your knowledge of TA.

# Pivot Point

The pivot **point, support and resistance calculations are widely accepted as the simplest yet most effective trading strategy.** They are well trusted by traders, banks and all financial institutions as clear indicators of the strength or weakness of the market. *They are used as the basis for most technical analysis*. **The pivot point is the point in which the market sentiment changes from bearish to bullish.**

For example, let's look at the candlestick chart for a ticker that I took from tradingview,

&#x200B;

[Example Candlestick Chart](https://preview.redd.it/cdv56c1km0m61.jpg?width=873&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83757b1f0769e06ca5f27ffeb1da8ac08bbe8601)

&#x200B;

R1 = (2 x Pivot Point) – Daily Low

R2 = Pivot Point + (Daily High – Daily Low)

S1 = (2 x Pivot Point) – Daily High

S2 = Pivot Point – (Daily High – Daily Low)

*R3 = Daily High + 2 x (Pivot Point – Daily Low)*

*S3 = Daily Low – 2 x (Daily High – Pivot Point)*

**LINKING BACK TO GME**

&#x200B;

[Pivot Point Data were taken from Investing.com](https://preview.redd.it/rbjrco9nm0m61.jpg?width=976&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f917346de8cdbbc3f5e333edb8b6073831cd1a9)

&#x200B;

GME-

Resistance Line 1: $195.13

Resistance Line 2: 202.33

Resistance Line 3: 215.87

*While writing this post $GME was hovering around $217* in pre-market (Which is higher than the current R3 value), all though the value is bound to change before the market opens, if $215 can be maintained during the opening; that **will ultimately see Resistance Level 3 becoming the new support line. This would depict a very strong bullish trend that can be aided by the RSI (Relative strength index)**

*You can ignore the Fibonacci, camarilla etc PP if you're new to TA but they basically show the same trend of the ticker having an uptrend.*

# Relative Strength Index

*The relative strength index (RSI) is a* *momentum indicator* *used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions* in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100

RSI below 30: Oversold, will rebound and may show divergence

Above 70: Overbought

&#x200B;

[GME RSI between march 4th and 8th](https://preview.redd.it/7ropbgzsm0m61.jpg?width=1201&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c7ae49ff044332e81020f8404647aa973073a99)

Current GME RSI value: 68 (Neutral)

*The data shows RSI value continuing in an uptrend (bullish) and is in line with the price of $GME as no divergence could be seen. Coupling it with the pivot points, if the same trend continues today and tomorrow we'll see a breakout and support lines forming around $215+*

**Disclaimer: My predictions are just me speculating and do not necessarily mean they are right. The increased volatility with low float means the price could go in any directions. But the indicators seem to be showing a healthy direction for a bullish market.**

**Now comparing this to the RSI before January squeeze:**

&#x200B;

[RSI before jan squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/8otntoxum0m61.jpg?width=455&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fda45bc0fd98a78cea2e04d90c88ed9187a36d91)

&#x200B;

RSI Value: 72.14

As seen from the second image, RSI trend before the breakout was in an uptrend. However, the slope was not as steep as we're currently seeing right now and when the price really started getting high, RSI showed a massive overbought. Comparing this back to the march RSI, that trend is still in the neutral territory and has potential for a more violent uptick as RSI value reaches the 70-75+ region.

# Volume Weighted Average Price

The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a trading benchmark used by traders that gives the average price security has traded throughout the day, based on both volume and price. *It is important because it provides traders with insight into both the trend and value of security.* Large institutional buyers and mutual funds use the VWAP ratio to help move into or out of stocks with as small of a market impact as possible. Therefore, when possible, institutions will try to buy below the VWAP, or sell above it. **This way their actions push the price back toward the average, instead of away from it.**

*VWAP calculates the sum of price multiplied by volume, divided by total volume.*

&#x200B;

[VWAP January 13th-22nd](https://preview.redd.it/jcps124xm0m61.jpg?width=131&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbb4877f7fa69b17429839bfa967c605d2b08d)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[VWAP March 1st-8th](https://preview.redd.it/s2sqhq2ym0m61.jpg?width=324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2916f02390c863ea8b815eaca847d618766f51e)

&#x200B;

* Blue Line indicates the volume-weighted average price. **Comparing both pictures, the vwap value in regards to each candlestick seems to show the same pattern.**
* VWAP has been above the average day trading price between 6 and 7th March, this seems to act like the support line for the price.
* **8th march and 22nd January show a similar pattern, both had a relatively significant increase in (=increased volatility and more violent price swings) as well as a positive slope gradient.**

# Moving Average Convergence Divergence

MACD is a trend-following [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period [exponential moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the ""signal line,"" is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. **Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line.**

&#x200B;

MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the chart below) which graphs the distance between the MACD and its signal line. If the MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline.

* **MACD in January showed a gradual increase till breakout, the march macd value is much stronger in regards to the trend and can see the signal line deviating away from the EM**A. Linking it back to the RSI uptrend, trend seems to be bullish and does not show any signs of divergence. *Outcome? Will probably continue this trend for the days to come*

# Other Indicators

Since I ran out of time and probably you apes have ran out of patience as well, I'm just going to list the other moving averages indications to summarise the trends.

[Indicator Values taken from trading view](https://preview.redd.it/dt8dgbo4n0m61.jpg?width=663&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=178b8def7cf54223bb626d78f7be1187159e0bd4)

&#x200B;

# TLDR

**Most (If not all) Moving average indicators show a very strong bullish market on a DAY scale as we can see the trend to continue to follow an uptrend. The Resistance level 3 pivot points may become the new support live if the RSI+MACD trend continues. Neither show divergence which is also a good sign.**

Anyways hope I've cleared some things out, and if the DD needs correction then please feel free to let me know so i can fix/include the data. **This is my last DD to the series and hope it has benefited people, I'll be taking some time off now to snort coke,** ***bon voyage*** **apes!**

NVAX,"OCGN’s COVID-19 vaccine. Covaxin, might receive govt funding 🚀

Important points from the conference today

* Differentiator Vaccine which has potential to work against other strains (tests on way)
* We are working with government agencies and we are hopeful we get a commitment and a contract.
* The govt will help us pick up distribution and supply for deploying the vaccine.
* We can also use our vaccine as booster for all of those who received other vaccines.
* We are in talks with FDA and they did comment on our interim data and they are happy with it.
* We will file for EUA as soon as we get more data published hopefully in beginning of April.
* 4 weeks after that we could receive EUA and start our supply of doses.
* USA release testing will happen via Ocugen control from a FDA approved laboratory -> ongoing
* Covaxin will have its own clinical trials for children in US if needed.
* More good news on Ocugen  ocu400 Pipeline coming soon.
* More than 50 million in run way currently.

EUA filing in April is faster than NVAX which are getting ready to file in May

# What is priced in FED Land ? 

Nearly a full hike in EOY 22 | 2.3 % Average fed funds over next 30 years | 10/2 at 143 bps which is a level last seen in Dec 2016 which is the peak of the Trump era.  
I Believe in light of recent fed communication that this is too aggressive. Fed communication has made it clear that what matters is u6 ^((the real unemployment figure)) and that their tolerance of the constraint is a “sustained overshoot of 50bps - Bullard or ""even 3% wouldn’t worry me as long as it’s not 3% on the way quickly to 4% - Evans   
For those who have offered concrete formulation of what the AIT, it is clear that what will be the rate hiking cause is NOT inflation but the path to max employment as, by all accounts and consensus, we will NOT reach such a high inflation path over a year. **Thus any Employment data surprise will be hawkish and vice versa Now that we have defined the optimization problem which the FED is solving**, let’s try to solve it using the data and see if we agree with the market:   


**CapEcon - (Does not take into account infra bill)**  
 We anticipate QE will be tapered from the start of 2022, and a very gradual rate liftoff will begin in mid-2023. We expect base-effects and fiscally stimulated growth will allow inflation to reach levels rarely experienced over the past decade, with headline inflation flirting with 3% and core inflation around 2.4%, Uncontrolled overheating isn’t likely if inflation expectations remain anchored. JPM forecast anticipates this move, but frames it as transitory volatility rather than trend. So should the Fed. Given that money markets are pricing an early Fed liftoff but TIPS markets are not pricing an inflation overshoot, either investors doubt the Fed or don’t understand it Markets likely to struggle to price in an even earlier Fed hike. Take profit on tactical longs in 5Y UST and stay neutral duration

**Barclays**   
Despite the sharp sell-off, long -term yields do not look high in the context of a stronger growth outlook. Still, front-end yields are inconsistent with the FAIT framework. We maintain our recommendation to be long 3y US Treasuries. Given the steepening, we are turning neutral on our front to intermediate steepener view. While it seems premature to declare that the hiking cycle (the start of which is two years away) would be finished within five years, with more stimulus likely down the road, there is some risk of an overshoot as well. Also, as we argued here, passage of an infrastructure plan later this year could still push long-term real yields higher. At the upcoming FOMC meeting, the Fed is likely to convey a greater tolerance for above-target inflation before raising short-rates than is priced in. This should push out the timing of the start of the hiking cycle, in our view. We view the rise in long-term yields as reflecting a brighter economic outlook. Progress on infrastructure spending poses upside risks to them.

**YELLEN**   
It would take 2 years at this rate to get back to pre covid u6 (puts us on March 23)

**GS** WITH INFRA /!\\   
the simulation implies 7% Q4/Q4 GDP growth in 2021, a decline in the unemployment rate to 3.7% in 2021Q4 and 3% by 2023Q4, a pickup in core inflation to 2.2% by 2023, and one to two rate hikes in 2023 under our interpretation of the Fed’s new framework. We expect FOMC participants to be more conservative in their projections at this early stage of the recovery, with a median forecast of 2.1% inflation and one rate hike in 2023. Our own forecast instead calls for liftoff somewhat later, in the first half of 2024, because our inflation forecast is a bit lower, reflecting a lesson from last cycle that an extremely tight labor market will likely be needed to generate the level of inflation that the FOMC now requires for liftoff.

**MS**   
While inflation in the reopening-sensitive sectors is likely to prove transient,a more sustainable impulse to inflation will start to take shape in 2021 – led by shelter inflation,healthcare services,and a multi-quarter passthrough of dollar weakness into goods. The sustainable inflation impulse intensifies in 2022as cyclically sensitive inflation components start to dominate – based on a tightening labor market and robust levels of demand. Core PCE to peak at 2.3 on DEC 22 !!!!*that TIPS-based breakeven inflation, based on CPI inflation measures, could move considerably higher and still be consistent with a PCE inflation outcome modestly above the 2% target.”*

**My own Conclusion** If you assume no infra or an infra bill that is close to entirely paid for via additional taxes and has a low multiplier we are definitely slightly above fair value in terms of rates. The Fed into FOMC next week WILL not assume an infra bill or its implications within the SEP thus in this case it is still possible to have a SEP that shows **no HIKE in 2023** So I cannot help but be bullish duration (& implications, see title) into FOMC March 16 and Auctions March 11 However - **Progress on infra / Data points indicating or suggesting faster path to min u6 will be hawkish EuroDollars (& implications)**   
I DO Believe there will be progress on an infra bill that will be generally expansionary in the end - thus the real trend is still an increase in real rates / ED and the implications that come with it : \* Gold down / \* TXN down / \* Dollar up vs EUR,CHF,Yen / \*NQ valuation down / \*Banks up / \*Value > Growth / But there should be a respite as we’ve already had strong progress in this direction and   
a) we will get a FED that, by ignoring the infra bill, will be able to push back VERY strongly through the SEP   
b) We are hearing stories of Manchin refusing to use fillibuster (which would make the infra bill A LOT Less exciting)   
How to trade this then ? Clearly, the real solution is to sell puts on NQ expiring soon to buy puts expiring later (apply that to all the other asset classes)

I Believe in light of recent fed communication that this is too aggressive. Fed communication has made it clear that what matters is u6 ^((the real unemployment figure)) and that their tolerance of the constraint is a “sustained overshoot of 50bps - Bullard or ""even 3% wouldn’t worry me as long as it’s not 3% on the way quickly to 4% - Evans   
For those who have offered concrete formulation of what the AIT, it is clear that what will be the rate hiking cause is NOT inflation but the path to max employment as, by all accounts and consensus, we will NOT reach such a high inflation path over a year. **Thus any Employment data surprise will be hawkish and vice versa Now that we have defined the optimization problem which the FED is solving**, let’s try to solve it using the data and see if we agree with the market:   


**CapEcon - (Does not take into account infra bill)**  
 We anticipate QE will be tapered from the start of 2022, and a very gradual rate liftoff will begin in mid-2023. We expect base-effects and fiscally stimulated growth will allow inflation to reach levels rarely experienced over the past decade, with headline inflation flirting with 3% and core inflation around 2.4%, Uncontrolled overheating isn’t likely if inflation expectations remain anchored. JPM forecast anticipates this move, but frames it as transitory volatility rather than trend. So should the Fed. Given that money markets are pricing an early Fed liftoff but TIPS markets are not pricing an inflation overshoot, either investors doubt the Fed or don’t understand it Markets likely to struggle to price in an even earlier Fed hike. Take profit on tactical longs in 5Y UST and stay neutral duration

**Barclays**   
Despite the sharp sell-off, long -term yields do not look high in the context of a stronger growth outlook. Still, front-end yields are inconsistent with the FAIT framework. We maintain our recommendation to be long 3y US Treasuries. Given the steepening, we are turning neutral on our front to intermediate steepener view. While it seems premature to declare that the hiking cycle (the start of which is two years away) would be finished within five years, with more stimulus likely down the road, there is some risk of an overshoot as well. Also, as we argued here, passage of an infrastructure plan later this year could still push long-term real yields higher. At the upcoming FOMC meeting, the Fed is likely to convey a greater tolerance for above-target inflation before raising short-rates than is priced in. This should push out the timing of the start of the hiking cycle, in our view. We view the rise in long-term yields as reflecting a brighter economic outlook. Progress on infrastructure spending poses upside risks to them.

We expect FOMC participants to be more conservative in their projections at this early stage of the recovery, with a median forecast of 2.1% inflation and one rate hike in 2023. Our own forecast instead calls for liftoff somewhat later, in the first half of 2024, because our inflation forecast is a bit lower, reflecting a lesson from last cycle that an extremely tight labor market will likely be needed to generate the level of inflation that the FOMC now requires for liftoff.

TL;DR up front:   
Don’t buy stocks in firearms or ammunition manufacturers just because you expect incoming legislation. The fact that people are buying lots of guns and bullets does \*not\* mean that gun manufacturers are raking in money hand over fist. The market could not possibly care less about your emotional investment one way or another in  the subject and you will lose money.   
BRIEF:   
There is a weird, sadistic, self-righteous ideology floating around that gun companies make loads of money off of tragedies and the threat of gun legislation.   
REGARDLESS OF YOUR FEELINGS ON FIREARMS, the numbers don’t pan out, and it’s a dumb, emotionally charged way to throw money around.   
If this was anything resembling a reliable way to make money, a lot more people would be doing it.   
I’m gonna get into some sensitive stuff here, apologies in advance. It’s not my intention to make anything resembling a political point, I only want to demonstrate that the threat of impending gun legislation does \*not\* impact the stock price of gun manufacturers. Nobody gives a shit about your politics here unless they make money. I’m not making money with this one, but rather, trying to help keep you from losing money. And that’s sort of the same thing. Unfortunately there’s only a sample size of three stocks, because gun manufacturers are small and not super valuable. Who’da thunk.   
I have compiled a list of 10 events where gun control was enacted, threatened, or speculated.

Don’t buy stocks in firearms or ammunition manufacturers just because you expect incoming legislation. The fact that people are buying lots of guns and bullets does \*not\* mean that gun manufacturers are raking in money hand over fist. The market could not possibly care less about your emotional investment one way or another in  the subject and you will lose money.   
BRIEF:   
There is a weird, sadistic, self-righteous ideology floating around that gun companies make loads of money off of tragedies and the threat of gun legislation.   
REGARDLESS OF YOUR FEELINGS ON FIREARMS, the numbers don’t pan out, and it’s a dumb, emotionally charged way to throw money around.   
If this was anything resembling a reliable way to make money, a lot more people would be doing it.   
I’m gonna get into some sensitive stuff here, apologies in advance. It’s not my intention to make anything resembling a political point, I only want to demonstrate that the threat of impending gun legislation does \*not\* impact the stock price of gun manufacturers. Nobody gives a shit about your politics here unless they make money. I’m not making money with this one, but rather, trying to help keep you from losing money. And that’s sort of the same thing. Unfortunately there’s only a sample size of three stocks, because gun manufacturers are small and not super valuable. Who’da thunk.   
I have compiled a list of 10 events where gun control was enacted, threatened, or speculated.

ASO,"

Academy Sports and Outdoors (Ticker : ASO) isn’t just the next Rocket or Gamestop. You shouldn’t view them as simply a squeeze opportunity. If you’re looking for just a squeeze and quick 100% gains without ever thinking about the stock again, this isn’t the post for you, it holds lots of info but I’m not spamming rocket emojis and this isn’t a P&amp;D scheme. 

Academy Sports and Outdoors is a retailer of sporting goods based out of Katy, Texas which is just to the west of Houston. They’ve been mostly concentrated in the Houston area, but recently have been expanding into areas throughout the Southern US. During their expansion their careful selection of store locations “has been that it has never had to close one of its new stores, all of which have been profitable since their first day of operation. “ (From Wikipedia). They’ve been in the business for over 50 years now and looking to grow under new owners Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. 

As a proud Texan and frequent customer of Academy, I can say that Academy has a huge advantage in the Houston area. Their outdoor competition consists of Recreational Equipment Incorporated (Smaller and most expensive) , Bass Pro Shops (Bigger selection, but less locations) , and Gander Mountain (Closed 100 stores after bankruptcy) While on the Sporting Goods side they compete with Sports Authority (bankrupt) and Dick’s Sporting Goods (only in malls). They have a good grip on the Houston area and are continuing expansion. 

I’m not going to do a deep dive into financials but I’ll focus on the three major points about the company. Debt, EPS Growth, and ROE. The company has been able to smash earnings throughout the Pandemic and their YoY growths have been incredible to say the least. However, to get this kind of growth, they had to take on debt to subsidize their growth. The shorts are betting that this is the downfall of the company but they aren’t thinking about the long-term effects of taking on this debt. They’re using it for considerable expansion in a time where everyone else is shutting down their stores to cut costs and Academy is taking it as their huge opportunity to expand. They have been able to successfully cut down on debt through the issuance of Senior Notes and Secondary Stock Offerings
just recently so they are making all the right moves to make sure the debt isn’t holding them back. The third and final point is their 24% ROE, I shouldn’t have to explain what this means other than you should be excited about their incredible margins.

In the future, we may see their expansion slow slightly because real estate costs will rise inevitably as the country reopens but they were able to successfully take advantage of this opportunity thanks to the nifty work of Ken Hicks and the rest of the board. While new properties will rise in value I think they will still have good growth. The Reopening means more business though as people return to their brick and mortar locations and even more in-store pickup rather than people ordering items from Amazon or EBay. They believe that the hobbies that people picked up will continue to drive sales (I can attest, Frisbee Golf is basically a subscription service to new disks considering how bad I am) and of course the main thing people mention on here is their firearms. I can’t see what’s a better retail recipe right now than Guns, in Texas, during national unrest, while the government is giving people more money to buy guns and ammo. 

Not that I’m a huge fan of national unrest, but Academy’s widespread gun sales and healthy variety are great for sales. Some stores have 4 whole aisles filled up with all the .38, 12 gauge, and .44 ammo anyone could ever need while other stores feature only 3 aisles because they need more aisles for fishing equipment in the summer. While unrest maybe a problem on a national level, Academy stands to profit hugely being one of the largest firearms retailers in the American South. Also, since Spring is upon us they will see upticks in sales for camping and fishing equipment as well as general sports sales. 

These factors are contributing to interest in the stock from both the shorts and retail investors alike. Today’s bullish nod from Barron’s with a $30 price target and rising momentum on this subreddit will make ASO a stock to watch in the upcoming weeks. I’m not trying to recommend that you buy the stock, but I’m giving you information to give you a different look at Academy as more than a simple short squeeze opportunity. Before buying the stock yourself, do more DD  to get a better feel for the company and consider the risks that investing contains. Best of luck to y’all in your endeavor for big tendies.

TLDR: Gun sales are rising and Academy is a major retailer. Have a huge advantage over competition in Texas and they have expanded throughout the pandemic. Excellent EPS growth, top-tier Return on Equity, and the debt situation is being remedied. Bullish nod from Barron’s and momentum on WSB is setting up a huge breakout.","Academy Sports and Outdoors, more than a Short Squeeze Opportunity",m0xfvs,83,187,0.8,187,0,,DD,False,True,1

[The Hive Mind Trader - Theory](https://preview.redd.it/h0sal7sy2xl61.jpg?width=256&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d7033601ffa63fc64c10ad7f85df32b78ad1cc3)

I have decided to post elements of my work that have led me to produce proven theories with a very high probability of success. Such as being able to preemptively determine when GME will go parabolic. This is not me stating, this has been witnessed and utilized by others with a determining factor of success. To include the study of unique behavior patterns of individual stocks and industry. The thing about data is it is no good unless someone else can learn it and benefit from it.

&#x200B;

With that said, I am posting the crude work. At some point, I will clean it all up so it can be prettier and even have a flow sheet of sorts, but right now, I want to keep the focus on the depth of work and get feedback from others of like mind.

&#x200B;

I truly believe that this community of new traders has good intentions with their money. The ability to ascertain data that is truly helpful is scarce. We can seek out the most mentioned post or the percentage change of posts. However, that kind of data, albeit helpful, ends once the person clicks through. My goal is to treat my data like open-source code. If a person could take what I have produced and make it better, then the purpose has been served.

&#x200B;

This theory provides you explicit data outcomes that will provide you with what stock to select based on industry, 5 selected companies that share the same industry, the volume, price. As detailed in theory within, the data can be easily replaced to produce a different response as long as you follow the theory's criteria.

&#x200B;

At the core, this theory has derivatives of Newton's First Law of Motion:

*An object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. (i.e., Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Objects at rest tend to stay at rest.)*

**EDIT 1**: I did forewarn it was crude, so I apologize about the chicken scratches. I am trying to perfect the theory. This is the very long-winded structure to the basis of my various theories. I can't go around and say,  **I can predict a GME parabolic event** with no basis in which to define it.

There is no TL;DR with this one. This is theory data and within is the algorithm in which to test it. I mean, if you could 10x your portfolio by piecing this theory together, your time would be well spent.

EDIT 2: Fixed a word that someone asked so nicely to fix. 

Edit 3: I will transfer all data from the images to a google doc. I don’t my chicken scratches to hinder interest or collaboration.

GOOGL,"TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM FOR THE RETARDS WHO CAN'T READ.

&#x200B;

Alright buckle up retards today we're going to answer a question that has managed to elude retards and algorithmic options traders who use Robinhood to exploit their free option trades for years.

Why the fuck is option order routing so bad? It always seems like I'm the last order to fill.

Well let me answer your question with another question What happens after you submit an order on Robinhood?

That we do know the answer to, and we shall go through it very quickly. Robinhood has their own order router, this does all the ""paperwork"" a trade needs for it to be able to be processed by a Market Maker, or by the execution venue.

So firstly, your order is sent to the RH order router, this first checks basic stuff, dividend risk, collateral req. checks, avail; funds checks, margin checks, and a PCO(position closing only) check. If any of that returns a false argument, the order is kicked back. If that's all good, the order is flashed onto the PFOF desk at Citadel Securities, they pay top dollar for the sweet, sweet dumb money pfof, that they will always adjust their books so that RH's order router routes to them first. Now Citadel has a set time to do with this order(because the exchanged price is still changing and of course its not public which is fucking fair right?). They can one: if the limit order on the marketbale option order is theo(theoretical price) + edge(which is hidden information due to game theory reasons), then the MM will fill you.

This can and does lead to something called price improvement. For example if the 69c for $ASS is trading at a spread of 0.69-0.86, with a theo of 0.74, the MM takes a 0.04 edge on the position, so any order above 0.78 will fill, which is technically better than paying 0.86 at the ask.

The problem with this however, is the rights to your order. Customer orders are supposed to have priority over MM orders on marketable option and equity tickers, BUT, MMs and Citadel rather take your order ""hostage"" with their own order placed on your behalf with flags set on the trade that a retail customer cannot set on their order.

I've been trading GOOGL intraday calls and puts, and discovered that orders that I was competing against would fill before me, even though I was supposedly the first one on the books(read exchange) on that price. So what? you might say, ""you got unlucky"", no I, you, or anyone else getting buttfucked by Robinhood is not ""unlucky"". The vast, vast majority of option and equity exchanges operate on FIFO w/contingencies. FIFO(First in First Out) means the first person to put up their sell, and first person who put up the bid side will be matched with each other, there is no luck to who gets an order, it who put in that order first. Now ""w/contingencies"" is supposed to be in the retail traders benefit, because that states that, even if a MM places an order before a customer, the customer will still be first. But clearly if you ever traded options on Robinhood, you'd realize **that's not the fucking case.**

So what the heck is goin' on?

I've done many hours of research to come to this conclusion, but all it is my best educated guess, with my knowledge of option order routing. Nothing about how Citadel routes orders, their edge threshold or how much time they hold the orders before moving it somewhere else(read different MM) is all private due to game theory reasons.

I am going to assume that once your order hits Citadels PFOF screens, and they don't want to fill your order at the current price. They will fire an identical order on their end, to the exchange, on your behalf(while nullifying the original order), this removes the CUST order specification, and allows them to get you the worst possible fill, while still giving you the BBO. Certain MM flags exist that actually allow last priority of an order, and it's very possible that they place that on your order. This will 100% of the time have your order be the last one on the books before the bid or ask changes.

&#x200B;

[Last Priority MM Order Flag](https://preview.redd.it/ysbb0tefuwl61.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=f82c2b29ec8bf7adb389dbe488748e4f25996b4c)

Why would they do this?

They edge themselves by positioning themselves a certain against your executed trade. You getting a shitty fill is Citadel getting an awesome fill. And that is vice versa, you getting an excellent fill is not as good(or shitty) for Citadel, or the MM who picks up your marketable option order. So Citadel wants good fills, and a good edge, so they have to fuck someone over to get that.

What can I do about it?

On other(read real) brokers, you can have your orders sent directly to your desired exchange, without sending directly to a market maker(a market maker can still fill the order on-the-screens), however your order will still have that holy CUST order specification. On Robinhood, there is nothing they can do unless they add execution options and options for specific order instructions, which they won't do.

&#x200B;

tl;dr - When buying options, Citadel likely puts your order on the screens on your behalf(instead of your original order from the app), doing this loses the CUST order specification, which gives your order priority over MMs, and customers trading on brokerages that can shoot orders directly on the exchange will have priority over you. That is the most probable reason as to why Robinhood's order routing is trash.

If you haven't seen the demo for either OS, check it out here!

Foundry is going to change the foundation of the typical supply chain with seamless data integration for live predictive models and active problem solving. With AWS, AMZN, offering an ERP suite with PLTR tech allows companies to save money instantly by integrating data to allow AI to find ways to be more profitable. BP saved 50 million within two weeks of using Foundry.

Gotham has been a staple for the U.S. military for active decision making and ""Gotham is an AI-ready platform that improves and accelerates decisions for operators at every echelon and in every domain — land, sea, air, space, and cyber.""

Any company that has massive amounts of data will turn to use PLTR services and continue to expand the commercial growth of the company. One of the biggest gripes of PLTR was its overreliance of revenue in the government sector. We are at a pivotal time where the company will continue to add contracts and get closer to profitability. Once we were completely out of the pandemic, companies will want to free up more capital to supplement the growth of the overall market i.e. higher operations costs. If you are discouraged, I would watch these demos. It will excite you.

MILE,"Background of company: An insurtech company dealing with car insurance. Different from all other  insurance companies in the space because they do insurance based on how much you drive. So people that drive less than 12,000 miles a year would save money using this. Great for high populated areas such as New York and San Fran. 

They are currently only running in 8 states so a huge growth opportunity when they expand. They have been beaten down a lot with this sell off and are below SPAC offering. 

Revenue and Competition: 
Their market cap is getting close to 1 billion with over 100 mill in revenue. Compare it to their competitor Lemonade which does different types of insurance they have comparable  revenue and growth but LMND market cap is 5 times that of Metro but Metro has more room to grow cause of the expansion of their market which is 42 more states and possibly out of the country. 

They also have a deal with Ford on new vehicles that they signed last year in December to help get their name out their and their tech is actually pretty good. 

They are also a SaaS company that can sell their tech to other insurance companies to use with the basis of tracking miles and calculating your insurance that way. 

They are beat down just like their competitors LMND and Root but are way undervalued compared to them with way more growth opportunities and are different than any other insurance company.",Metromile (MILE) great value play at this point,m0uohz,18,18,0.65,18,0,,DD,False,True,-1

TSLA,"This is my first DD, feel free to go in raw and no rubber, nuts to butts with your criticism

1. Backed by the CCP

“Generally speaking, the Chinese government has been willing to pull several policy levers to support the EV industry. These include incentives such as purchase rebates and tax exemptions. For instance, the government had restrictions around securing a license plate to limit the number of new vehicles on the road to reduce pollution. However, several local governments have been lifting these restrictions on the purchase of new EVs.” - ([https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nio-motors-nyse%3A-nio-has-chinese-government-support%3A-but-do-the-risks-outweigh-the](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nio-motors-nyse%3A-nio-has-chinese-government-support%3A-but-do-the-risks-outweigh-the))

The CCP has previously given $NIO government subsidies, as well as implementing pro EV and pro $NIO policy changes, showing that they are willing to be active supporters of $NIO both financially and in regards to favorable legislation. If $NIO is in trouble, the CCP will not want them to go under, as they are arguably China's biggest contender against $TSLA in the EV market.

&#x200B;

2. Reasons for recent price movements

There are two causes for the recent price movements. $NIO started to decline following the release of its quarterly earnings, despite them not performing particularly poorly. From the Earnings Report:

* Vehicle deliveries were up 42.2% from Q3
* Vehicle sales were up 44.7% from Q3
* Total revenue was up 46.7% from Q3
* Gross margin (How much money the company retains from sales) was up 4.3% from Q3

While the earnings report may not have completely met analysts’ expectations for the company, they still show that $NIO continues to grow as a company.

The second potential cause of $NIO’s decline is that it’s just following the trend of other companies in the EV industry. This argument is much more valid than earnings, at least in my opinion, but I believe that there is still an argument to be had in regards to this. The combined market cap of EV manufacturers is allegedly lower than that of traditional auto manufacturers employing internal combustion engines in their vehicles (Source: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/ev-stocks-crash-tesla-market-value-51614983454](https://www.barrons.com/articles/ev-stocks-crash-tesla-market-value-51614983454))

&#x200B;

3. Market Cap compared to competitors

$NIO(55.15B) has a lower market cap than both $TSLA(540.40B) and $GM(79.22B), and there is a significant amount of room for $NIO to grow in the future. The market cap of $TSLA shows us the potential that a successful EV company has if grown correctly.

&#x200B;

4. Potential for future growth

Although $TSLA vehicle sales/deliveries are far better than $NIO’s, if $NIO continues its consistent growth into the future it isn’t unlikely that we will continue to see share prices increase into the future.

$NIO also has plans for expanding into foreign markets. Currently, they have only sold vehicles in China, but CEO William Li has announced plans to expand into international markets soon(European markets the second half of this year, and he plans further expansion in 2022, Source: [https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/)). So far, $NIO has only sold cars in 1 country, but there are 195 countries in the world, so by 2022 we should expect the market cap to be 10.725 Trillion dollars /j

&#x200B;

5. The actual products

In order to drive an EV, you obviously need a charged battery, because driving with no power is something you can’t do. With Teslas, you need to charge your car for 30 minutes without a supercharger, or one hour without one before being able to drive 44 miles (source:[https://www.tesla.com/support/charging#:\~:text=How%20fast%20can%20I%20charge,the%20fastest%20possible%20charging%20speed](https://www.tesla.com/support/charging#:~:text=How%20fast%20can%20I%20charge,the%20fastest%20possible%20charging%20speed).), however this is not a problem with Nio cars, because of their Quick Swap battery system. You can just put a new battery into the car and continue driving, which is a huge advantage in terms of practicality. This is a huge advantage in and of itself, and if Nio continues to develop technology to rival Tesla’s, they definitely have the potential to be extremely competitive.

&#x200B;

With the recent changes, now is the perfect time to grab $NIO at a discount, as it will likely continue to grow due to the above reasons.

**TL;DR:** $NIO has government backing, a lot of space to grow and expand in terms of markets and market cap, and continues to see consistent growth.

SP,"My fellow degenerates, it has come to my attention that Jim Cramer (Virgin), has advised his legion of boomers to sell Palantir Technologies. I am posting this to present a long term bullish case for Palantir, and why I think this recent sell-off is a great buying opportunity.

First, I am disputing the reliability of Cramer's picks. According to a 2016 study, the S&P 500 outperformed Cramer by 6% over a 15 year period. [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jim-cramer-doesnt-beat-the-market-2016-05-13](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jim-cramer-doesnt-beat-the-market-2016-05-13) .  I further contend that most positive performance is due to boomers mindlessly following his advice and thereby contributing to buying pressure, rather than high quality fundamental or technical analysis.

Second, Palantir Technologies' Gotham Software is widely used throughout government sectors, and it's Foundry Software is becoming largely incorporated for commercial purposes. Palantir has experienced 40% YoY revenue growth, with analyst forecasts of a 68% revenue increase in 2021, and unlike many high-flying tech companies, has not relied on large amounts of debt to sustain itself. This limits the downside risk, and even has Morningstar assigning it an undervalued rating. We are not known as value investors on this thread, but when companies that should be trading at 3x their so called ""fair value"" are trading below it, it's a good sign for full degenerates.

Third, Palantir's RSI is drifting closer to oversold territory, with a 25% increase in shares short since January 29th. The MACD is currently drifting away from the signal line, but we should see bounce back/resistance at around the $20-21 mark, as we did last Friday. This will present a good opportunity for the bulls, as Alex ""The Magic"" Karp kicks the bears back up the stream.",BULL! Cramer will get BTFO'd on Palantir,m0seel,67,129,0.89,129,0,,DD,False,True,1

Here is my [DD on Chinese EVs PUTs play Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljwqf5/celebrate_chinese_new_year_with_puts_on_nio_xpev/). The drop wasn't really due to any of the shit I said before (yet), everything was bleeding, but when life throws money at you, you shake dat a$$.

Took profits throughout last week, can see the [Xpeng gains](https://imgur.com/x6SSu50) here and [Nio gains here](https://imgur.com/SCpGZsM). Could've been more, but I ain’t fuckin Miss Celo.

**Why'd you sell pussy?**  
I'm just playing the dip. I had to get into some other positions, and will load up again at the top when we dead cat bounce, everything explained below. This ain't financial advice, I just don't like these stocks.

Let’s check in on Q1 2021 projected PS ratios as of Friday’s close. These are going to real interesting once we get to Q1 earnings.

TSLA: 15.7

NIO: 17

XPEV: 15.3

Li: 10

There were some short term catalysts in the mix that also sprayed fuel to the fire last few weeks.

\- Nio missing EPS, hemorrhaging money

\- XPeng stock lock up period ended

\- Lackluster feb delivery numbers from both

Well, how do you keep the growth story fueled? You need to grow Rev. How do you grow Rev? You need to grow deliveries. For all the reasons described in [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljwqf5/celebrate_chinese_new_year_with_puts_on_nio_xpev/), I don’t see them breaking out in the sea of competition. For some reason, people think Nio and Xpeng are the only 2 EV companies in China. I did a casual forecast on deliveries for Feb. [Look at it and tell me where Nio and Xpev sits](https://imgur.com/8G5dlPt). This is not even all the smaller, upcoming players who didn't make top 20...

Yes, there is a Chinese new year effect in Feb on deliveries. All the millennials head to their hometowns from big cities, gloat to their parents about how much money they made, get questioned on when they’re going to get married. Little do they know, they’ve just been in a claustrophobic 1b apartment, stroking it to Fan BingBing on the daily. Ok, I digress, in reality, Nio and Xpeng have tiny pepe order books, and if you’re actually a hot growing EV brand, CNY shouldn’t affect you that much. Just look for Feb 2020 in [the most updated deliveries chart](https://insideevs.com/news/486669/china-tesla-model-3-sales-january-2021/). (Tesla Feb 2021 numbers will be out next week, I’m betting on this).

Nio’s EPS miss was no surprise if you look at their cost centers. They posted a growing, healthy vehicle margin, but tucked away a sickening amount of costs, just like your secret cum bucket.

\- All their early adopters, till last month, were still getting FR33 LIFE TIME battery swaps. So much for those service Revenue dreams

\- All those pretentious ass NIO houses? Prime real estate locations, yeah you bet rent is expensive AF. This doesn’t even scale, if NIO drops vehicle prices (which they need to if they want to grow) = more NIO customers = crowding NIO Houses = less desirable. Forget crazy, even Sane Rich Asians don’t like to share with plebs, even without covid.

Xpeng doesn’t have it any better. There are 13,000 vehicles being recalled. I mean, that’s pretty much their entire Q of deliveries, Q1 earnings is going to be a bloodbath. Oh, shares lockup also ended on 2/23/2021, what would you do when your company is a get rich quick copy of Tesla? You dump those shares faster than Bogdanoff can make a call on his BB.

**Outlook for 2021**

Is Nio and Xpeng going to 0? Not right now, they’ve got more tricks and the YT pumpers haven’t gone through the 5 stages of grief yet. We'll likely see a dead cat bounce. Will wait until all these Nio ""investors"" are back in their circle jerking habitat, then pull the trigger and load up PUTs again.

Let’s dispel some of these dilutions being force fed to you. It's time wake your ass up from that confirmation biased wet dream.

1. Competition is fuckin fierce in China. Nio themselves have already cut their guidance, but based on chips shortage. I’d bet it’s more than just the Pringles, since CN Government tax credit got cut starting 2021.
2. “CCP is backing Nio!” Yes, Nio has gotten some support from Hefei, a [TIER 2 city in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_city_tier_system). A single Tier 2 city does not equal the CCP. All these small city govs are trying to claw up the power ladder, so they can play in the big Tier 1 city leagues. As soon as Nio shows signs of weakness, they’ll drop’em without a second thought. Just like when your wife finds out were 100% maxed margins on NIO from last week.
3. “But global expansion!” Here we go again. Besides what I already said in Part 1 about western demand for “Made in China” cars, think about it. Nio and Xpeng are playing in the biggest EV market in the world, instead of focusing attention on their home turf, where they’re still far from winning, they’re trying to expand overseas?

Nio and Xpeng are in the back view mirror for now, will load up PUTs again after the bounce. But the [EV revolution is still happening](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1130699_survey-7-out-of-10-americans-see-an-ev-in-the-future-want-more-vehicle-choices-and-charging). Who do you bet on?

My TSLA position got beat up like Elon in grade school. But just like papa in 2018, I’m doubling down and holding shares like a boomer. With the nice volatility we’re going to see in this upcoming kangaroo market, I’m taking advantage of the sky high IVs and selling CCs after short term catalysts.

1. CN Feb deliveries for Tesla, that’s coming next week. This will be the first peak at Model Y numbers. You bet there is going to be movement, I sure am. See my naked calls above.
2. For those of you that are looking at Tesla and think it’s still got a long way down to go, think again. Tesla's bottom line is about to get juicier when Q1 numbers roll around. For all the crying about Tesla making most of its profits from credits, it’s only about to get even more lucrative. Credits are not going away, take a look at [the schedules (ZEV for example)](https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Document/I505CA51BB0AD454499B57FC8B03D7856?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default)), it's only ramping up towards 2025. Simple supply and demand, more credits needed, [legacy auto EVs deliveries absent](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311594/ford-mustang-mach-e-delays-quality-free-charging-cash-back), Tesla has them for sale.
3. FSD is about to make the news cycle again. [Elon said subs are coming Q2](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1366514764868775936). But hey, you don’t have to believe the boy who cried wolf, because Auntie Cathie will save the day with [ARK’s new report on Autonomy and PT on Tesla](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/03/19997280/ark-more-convicted-on-teslas-autonomous-strategy-and-cathie-wood-says-a-new-price-target). It’s nice when you have the hottest (popular…) fund manager pumping your stock.

At the end of the day, this correction could go on longer, but there is no existential crisis here. Tesla is going to keep selling cars like Samoa flavored girl scout cookies. Those Credits and Sub Revenues will flow straight to the bottom line on earnings.

Next up, 🚀 Lab. I won’t go into it, [you can read my post on it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwffta/rocket_labs_dd_found_the_company_that_actually/).

Took profits throughout last week, can see the [Xpeng gains](https://imgur.com/x6SSu50) here and [Nio gains here](https://imgur.com/SCpGZsM). Could've been more, but I ain’t fuckin Miss Celo.

**Why'd you sell pussy?**  
I'm just playing the dip. I had to get into some other positions, and will load up again at the top when we dead cat bounce, everything explained below. This ain't financial advice, I just don't like these stocks.

Let’s check in on Q1 2021 projected PS ratios as of Friday’s close. These are going to real interesting once we get to Q1 earnings.

TSLA: 15.7

NIO: 17

XPEV: 15.3

Li: 10

There were some short term catalysts in the mix that also sprayed fuel to the fire last few weeks.

\- Nio missing EPS, hemorrhaging money

\- XPeng stock lock up period ended

\- Lackluster feb delivery numbers from both

Well, how do you keep the growth story fueled? You need to grow Rev. How do you grow Rev? You need to grow deliveries. For all the reasons described in [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljwqf5/celebrate_chinese_new_year_with_puts_on_nio_xpev/), I don’t see them breaking out in the sea of competition. For some reason, people think Nio and Xpeng are the only 2 EV companies in China. I did a casual forecast on deliveries for Feb. [Look at it and tell me where Nio and Xpev sits](https://imgur.com/8G5dlPt). This is not even all the smaller, upcoming players who didn't make top 20...

Yes, there is a Chinese new year effect in Feb on deliveries. All the millennials head to their hometowns from big cities, gloat to their parents about how much money they made, get questioned on when they’re going to get married. Little do they know, they’ve just been in a claustrophobic 1b apartment, stroking it to Fan BingBing on the daily. Ok, I digress, in reality, Nio and Xpeng have tiny pepe order books, and if you’re actually a hot growing EV brand, CNY shouldn’t affect you that much. Just look for Feb 2020 in [the most updated deliveries chart](https://insideevs.com/news/486669/china-tesla-model-3-sales-january-2021/). (Tesla Feb 2021 numbers will be out next week, I’m betting on this).

Nio’s EPS miss was no surprise if you look at their cost centers. They posted a growing, healthy vehicle margin, but tucked away a sickening amount of costs, just like your secret cum bucket.

\- All their early adopters, till last month, were still getting FR33 LIFE TIME battery swaps. So much for those service Revenue dreams

\- All those pretentious ass NIO houses? Prime real estate locations, yeah you bet rent is expensive AF. This doesn’t even scale, if NIO drops vehicle prices (which they need to if they want to grow) = more NIO customers = crowding NIO Houses = less desirable. Forget crazy, even Sane Rich Asians don’t like to share with plebs, even without covid.

Xpeng doesn’t have it any better. There are 13,000 vehicles being recalled. I mean, that’s pretty much their entire Q of deliveries, Q1 earnings is going to be a bloodbath. Oh, shares lockup also ended on 2/23/2021, what would you do when your company is a get rich quick copy of Tesla? You dump those shares faster than Bogdanoff can make a call on his BB.

**Outlook for 2021**

Is Nio and Xpeng going to 0? Not right now, they’ve got more tricks and the YT pumpers haven’t gone through the 5 stages of grief yet. We'll likely see a dead cat bounce. Will wait until all these Nio ""investors"" are back in their circle jerking habitat, then pull the trigger and load up PUTs again.

Let’s dispel some of these dilutions being force fed to you. It's time wake your ass up from that confirmation biased wet dream.

1. Competition is fuckin fierce in China. Nio themselves have already cut their guidance, but based on chips shortage. I’d bet it’s more than just the Pringles, since CN Government tax credit got cut starting 2021.
2. “CCP is backing Nio!” Yes, Nio has gotten some support from Hefei, a [TIER 2 city in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_city_tier_system). A single Tier 2 city does not equal the CCP. All these small city govs are trying to claw up the power ladder, so they can play in the big Tier 1 city leagues. As soon as Nio shows signs of weakness, they’ll drop’em without a second thought. Just like when your wife finds out were 100% maxed margins on NIO from last week.
3. “But global expansion!” Here we go again. Besides what I already said in Part 1 about western demand for “Made in China” cars, think about it. Nio and Xpeng are playing in the biggest EV market in the world, instead of focusing attention on their home turf, where they’re still far from winning, they’re trying to expand overseas? That’s like getting into foreplay with Kendall Jenner, but you’re licking your lips and looking at Bruce in the other room!

2. For those of you that are looking at Tesla and think it’s still got a long way down to go, think again. Tesla's bottom line is about to get juicier when Q1 numbers roll around. For all the crying about Tesla making most of its profits from credits, it’s only about to get even more lucrative. Credits are not going away, take a look at [the schedules (ZEV for example)](https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Document/I505CA51BB0AD454499B57FC8B03D7856?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default)), it's only ramping up towards 2025. Simple supply and demand, more credits needed, [legacy auto EVs deliveries absent](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311594/ford-mustang-mach-e-delays-quality-free-charging-cash-back), Tesla has them for sale.
3. FSD is about to make the news cycle again. [Elon said subs are coming Q2](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1366514764868775936). But hey, you don’t have to believe the boy who cried wolf, because Auntie Cathie will save the day with [ARK’s new report on Autonomy and PT on Tesla](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/03/19997280/ark-more-convicted-on-teslas-autonomous-strategy-and-cathie-wood-says-a-new-price-target). It’s nice when you have the hottest (popular…) fund manager pumping your stock.

At the end of the day, this correction could go on longer, but there is no existential crisis here. Tesla is going to keep selling cars like Samoa flavored girl scout cookies. Those Credits and Sub Revenues will flow straight to the bottom line on earnings.

Next up, 🚀 Lab. I won’t go into it, [you can read my post on it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwffta/rocket_labs_dd_found_the_company_that_actually/). This is going to be the beginnings of the next EV-like rally. When you can’t buy SpaceX, Rocket Labs is your BFF. You can bet it'll be in ARKX.

SONO,"Listen up all you man babies.  If you're interested in making money the play tomorrow is to buy Sonos (SONO) before 3 PM EST.  Why is that time so specific?  Because tomorrow Sonos is having an investor day in the afternoon.  Where they will announce new products! Talking about the future! And (likely) raise their 2021 guidance! 

Sonos is one of the more undervalued companies still on the market and below I talk about reasons you should get in now.  They are a well positioned company for both 'stay home' and 'reopen' trades and their CEO is a boss.  They will crush tomorrow and the weakness their stock showed today on low volume should be taken advantage of immediately. 

TL;DR?  Buy Sonos on its weakness today and get in tomorrow before 3 PM EST to get in on this moon mission. 

**What is a Sonos?**

*From Yahoo: Sonos, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, and sells multi-room audio products in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific. The company provides wireless speakers, home theater speakers, components, and accessories. It offers its products through approximately 10,000 third-party retail stores, including custom installers of home audio systems; and e-commerce retailers, as well as through its Website* [*sonos.com*](https://sonos.com)*. The company was formerly known as Rincon Audio, Inc. and changed its name to Sonos, Inc. in May 2004. Sonos, Inc. was founded in 2002 and is headquartered in Santa Barbara, California.* 

Basically Sonos makes incredible home speakers and audio related devices mostly for an at home setting.  They hold over 775 patents and are currently applying for over 500 more. Their speaker systems are so solid that Alphabet (google) and Amazon have tried to steal their technology. Sonos is currently in litigation against both of them and they've said they except to have the Alphabet litigation settled in their favor by the end of the year (GREAT FOR EARNINGS). 

**Reasons for buying them long term:**

I could spend this whole post talking about how they saw the coming supply chain issues and quickly worked through them.  How their CEO is has partnered with IKEA to get Sonos' systems in front of eyeballs who are looking to buy new furniture and now can add a TV sound system on the way out, or how they are going to release up to 3 new products this year. No I'm only going to focus on TOMORROW. 

**Reason #1 for buying them TOMORROW:** 

New product announced.  Go look at Sonos' stock twits, Seeking Alpha page, or even their Yahoo Finance new feed.  No one is talking about their new product they're going to announce.  It's already been leaked.  It's the Sonos Roam.  A lightweight wireless speaker where you can take anywhere.  A fantastic new addition to their stable as people want to spend more time outside this year. 

[Here's a link to the Verge talking about the details of it](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22317082/sonos-roam-features-trueplay-sound-swap-leak-specs-price)

But here's why this is important. The average investor or algo hasn't picked up on this because it hasn't hit any of the media they cover.  It's going to be new information to them.  While you'll have the leg up on it. 

The Roam is likely to be their main announcement tomorrow but since they leaked this people are expecting another announcement, like in the headphone space.  

To give you an idea of how big the headphone announcement might be Kingston just sold the HyperX headphone brand to HP, for nearly half a billion dollars.  If you give Sonos that same market cap increase, that's worth 12% upside from it's closing price today. 12%! Because of a product announcement. 

**Reason #2 management wants to talk 2021 guidance:** 

Let's imagine you're having an investor day a month after you last earnings call. Things are going just okay.  Do you want to make it a point to talk guidance during your new product presentation? NO, you don't.  You hope things get better and just reaffirm you current guidance.  

Now let's pretend things are going great.  That your team is currently crushing the current Q's numbers.  You have an investor day coming up, what a perfect opportunity to tell everyone that you're going to raise guidance and likely crush those low numbers again with the new products. 

Situation number 2 is what is likely to happen. Management made it a point to let people know they'll be talking earnings and guidance during the meeting tomorrow. Management only does this if they're confident. 

**Reason #3 no supply chain issues:**

I'm cheating a little, this is more of a long term investment reason but it's likely to get brought up tomorrow.  Sonos' management team has been open about their supply chain struggles last year, and vowed to fix them.  During their last conference call they talked about how with the latest shipping issues they were not caught flat footed and have a solid pipeline of materials to build their products. Which is likely why they might raise guidance tomorrow. 

**Reason #4 new partnerships for Sonos Radio:** 

I'll let others who have Beams talk about this, not just me, but Sonos radio is super solid and an amazing long term growth addition to Sonos' catalog of products. The streaming service is fantastic when you just want a mood or type of music but don't want to deal with Spotify or Pandora playlists. They've been getting bigger and bigger names to partner up with them and create a curated playlist.  They will likely announce a few new ones tomorrow, and talk in detail about the reoccurring revenue of Sonos Radio. 

**In conclusion:**

Sonos is one of the few companies I feel it worthwhile to take a risk on in this environment. Its got huge long term tailwinds that I'm happy to talk about in more detail, but tomorrow is going to be a big uppie day.  So feel free to be in on Sonos with a cheaper buy in price.  Than buy in on Wednesday for 10% more.

Edit: this is not financial advice


As you can see, most of things going on with GME right now are just MSM being paid to lure normies into selling their positions. For background, I work in one of the major finance companies, not on finance but with machine learning/time series prediction, but I've lots of meetings with lots of people, and people talk. I can't give away too much info because it may cost my job, but the deep shit going on is over the charts, in 100 years this event will be spoken of.


First of all, not all hedge funds shorted GME, this is important because of what is about to happen, some funds managers are actually selling the assholes of their wives and first born sons to banks to get loans, I'm speaking of exorbitant amounts, remember that 35% of the dollars ever printed were printed last year, guess who is going to get a big piece of that ? Why ? They want to be the bigger fish on the aquarium, WSB opened the door for few hedge funds to expand brutally by destroying others.


Maybe people here didn't realize yet what they started, but it has epic proportions and you are living it right now. Second, big hedge funds are partnering up, but this is where comes the problem, imagine that you will try to rob a bank, what make you sure that the people that you partner with won't kill you to have less people to share the money with ? This is the current situation, this is the waiting, hedge funds, including the company that I work with are waiting for the money, and to see who they can trust. In the end they will all backstab each other, this is the finance industry, you can't deny it. Because soon as the price skyrocket to alpha centauri, guess who will be greedy to start another fucked up short ? Yes, the hedge funds, all over again, but is far easier to short at 750$, so is just a matter of who will short first. At work lots of people are absurdly greedy regarding shorting it, that was what created this opportunity, but some people never learn.


This is why you should hold, I'm holding just for fun and to see this shit show, if one day I sell, I will get the dollar bills and put in a frame in my wall, we are living the WW III of financial markets, now we are on the ships awaiting to arrive to the beach on a new D day, meanwhile some hedge funds are on our side (long, but don't think that they care about you as a person) coming with the atomic bombs. One risk that we escalated at work is that paper hands (as you like to call them) may sell leaving the other funds not vulnerable to a massive attack, rendering all this useless. Hold if you can, this is a game of patience, soon the direction will change, fucking huge buy orders will come and they will artificially inflate the price while other funds will have to think fast on get bankrup sooner, or be bankrupt later.


Can't say much, but few funds already gave their CEOs and managers some quite fat bonuses, why ? This is the last song, last dance, they are looting the ship before it sinks. You have no reason to believe in me, I'm a random guy on the internet, but pay attention to the fucking events that are going on, and you will understand that this is much bigger than just making few bucks. If you put all of this together, you will see that the silence of operations (see the fucking low volume) means the silence before the storm.

Good morning, good afternoon and good evening again my fellow retards around the world

This is a followup on my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzsnlk/gme_squezze_dd_moon_soon_possibly/), in which I already announced i would do one, if there are people actually reading my post. Hope you are still interested.

**Some remarks relating to the feedback I received on my previous post:**

1. You retards did what 12 years of school education couldnt: I finally can spell squeeze correctly.- Appreciate it.
2. That is actually all concerning general remarks. Just wanted to thank you for No. 1 and also: Great comment by [u/Calithrix](https://www.reddit.com/u/Calithrix/). I actually tried to consolidate(collateralize) some of the previous DDs on GME. But please dont be Bear Stearns and just buy it instead try to do your own DD.

**Why it could be dipping this week and why this would be a good thing?**

So lets start by answering why it is a good thing, if it actually dips this week. If the price is lower **delta** of options is actually **lower**, because the delta of an option has a positive correlation with the probability of being ITM for call options and being OTM for put options. And if the price is lower the probability that an call option becoming ITM or an put option becoming OTM is lower. For more info on that I just can again refer to [u/Natural\_Profession\_8](https://www.reddit.com/u/Natural_Profession_8/) [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz8mgr/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma/).

And a **lower delta** means less shares already hedged, meaning if the price goes up again all of a sudden, more shares needed to be bought. It is easier to get it up for whales when the price is low and thats why they could let the price intentionally drop this week.

Also a dip could mean shorts are getting FOMO and open new shorts (Thats what happened the previous 5 years and led to the high Short interest in the first place).

**Some other requirements for a squeeze**

* You need definitely a catalyst for any squeeze. Here are some possible dates:

1. 03/24 Earnings
2. 03/08 Stimmy checks (actually today lol)
3. find other possible catalysts in [u/HeyItsPixeL](https://www.reddit.com/u/HeyItsPixeL/) post. (couldnt link cause of WSB guidelines but just look at his Endgame post with a lot of Upvotes)

* It is actually not that important that a certain price is reached, it is more important that its going up fast. Then Delta is moving fast and MMs need to hedge fast.
* Thats also the reason why I dont thinks short are gonna play a huge role in the squeeze. They are not forced by their programs to buy GME unless they are margin called for which we actually need an incredibly huge price increase. I am talking prices in the thousands, which could be reached by a gamma squeeze but not solely because of a catalyst.

**Some final thoughts**

* You probably already noticed Im less bullish than other DDs on GME here. With the reason for that being, that I actually believe most of the official number. Yeah I could be wrong about that and there is actually a huge conspiracy behind all of that. And Yeah I know there happened some crazy things. But these are actually all easily explainable without needing a conspiracy theory: A lot of people liked the stock and bought it, this caused some rapid price movement, which was supported by some gamma squeeze. Then RobinHood and other brokers had liquidity problems because they needed to come up with a few billion dollars. But no one wants the public to know, that you have liquidity problems, so you come up with excuses. It all makes sense.
* Some words on the emotionalization about the stock: WSB being the Good 🦍🦍🦍 with 💎🤲 who are fighting the evil hedgefunds, who want to short GME into insolvency. I also love the story. But I stop liking the story, when people are actually betting their student loans on that shit. Its not that funny anymore then. With that being said, I hope all of you, who betted your student loans on it, will laugh at me soon from your Teslas (Hopefully theyll have enough production capacities, even with GIGA Berlin its going to be tight🚀🚀🚀), but try to bet only money you can lose next time. There is no such thing as certainty in the stock market (otherwise we wouldnt be here but already at the Tesla store) but there is the possibility and thats all that matters. 🌚

# Chekov's Shotgun

[Yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzd9js/goev_the_bull_case_of_canoo_inc_aka_goev_aka/?sort=new) we explored this stock to a small degree.  The adventure was personal and I appreciate you listening.  One person pointed out my ellipses were excessive. Thank you for that.   Another person told me I was retarded.  Thank you for that.  Many people were encouraged by my lack of financial literacy and tin foil hat philosophy. This is concerning.  I can, however, only assure you that when the MathChads (u/pennyether, u/manponzi)  and a Cartesian Ghost Aka Godfather Aka Hall9000 Aka /u/jn_ku showed up and told me that I wasn't entirely stupid.

**I figured I was on to something.**

My argument is this -

**1 -** GOEV is oversold.  It is still well below the 20day MVA.  Macromarket forces have been pushing this down more than it deserves.  There is probably some sort of effort to get out from underneath a falling piano of EV hype + SPAC disgust.  I believe that Canoo is farther along than many other plays.  CanooBros will chime in and tell you all about it.

**2** \- There is a solid amount of Short Interest.  Ortex tells us that the short interest increased to 9.2 M shares up from 8.5 Million shares. Data suggests the shorts are in from 17-20.  This is the zone we need to be in..Utilization is at 100 which means that shorts are either recycling shares, ortex doesn't know where the shares are obtained from, or MM are utilizing naked exceptions to provide shares. ^(Or there is naked shorting. Shhhhh)

**3** \- There is an upcoming catalyst of a Motor Press Guild (AKA real shit) is hosting a digital conference with big names like VW, JEEP, Honda, Acura, Fisker, Karma and Canoo.  Fisker and Karma are lining up for the luxury sedan crossover SUV and won't be competing with Canoo.  Canoo seeks to disrupt the market by designing a skateboard where different vehicles will be built on top of.  Again CanooBros tell us all about it below.  They have now detailed what the reveal is and it is ""*Canoo Pick-up Truck world premiere presented by Tony Aquila, Executive Chairman, Canoo with Bryan Biniak, Founder & CEO, Connected Travel*"".  Whatever it is, we need something that revalues the company.  IMHO if they discuss manufacturing and delivery date. You might be able to move out of the basement. We'll see.

# Pulling Its Trigger

The Data in the table below was aggregated by /u/pennyether and was first brought to my attention by  [u/manpozi](https://www.reddit.com/u/manpozi/) .

The way you should read this is what's known as delta hedging.  Simply put when market makers sell an options contract they must purchase a certain number of shares to remain delta neutral.  This is figured out by magic math.  But as the price moves towards the strike price and the date market makers must purchase more and more shares.

|**Price Point**|**#Shares Delta Hedged**|**Float %**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**11**|**1,748,226**|**1.75%**|
|**12**|**2,036,243**|**2.86%**|
|**13**|**4,032,127**|**4.03%**|
|**14**|**5,232,170**|**5.23%**|
|**15**|**6,422,140**|**6.42 %**|
|**16**|**7,581,094**|**7.57 %**|

\*\*This table will fluxuate as the options chain moves around. \*\*

What's important here is that there is relatively low free float and a decent amount of shorting going on and based on Ortex Data the shorts are out of cheap ammo.

This is tactical warfare.  Bigger forces are already at work setting this up.  Some whales are giving shorts enough rope to hang themselves with.  With the EV truck announcement.  All it takes is one quick shove in the right direction...

According to [u/manpozi](https://www.reddit.com/u/manpozi/) 13617 Calls were placed vs 1063 Puts today... that's 10x Call VS Puts.. Giddyup.

# IS GE THE SAME AS GME?

Not the same, but share some similar characteristics

* Both stock have been beaten down into oblivion (See comparison chart below)
* Before DFV, who the fuck invests in GME? Now, who the fuck invests in GE?
* Both stock have HIGH upside when it is consolidating at the bottom
* Both stock have special external conditions that make it an interesting R / R play
* GME was over shorted and had fresh talent take over from CHEWY
* GE  is in a special moment in US history when an Infrastructure Bill by the  Gov could pave the way for a turnaround for General Electric (more on  that later)

# (SPECULATIVE) FUNDAMENTALS

Aside  from the technical, I’m also BETTING that the Post Pandemic era is  going to send this stock back up to test previous highs.

1. Pandemic - For obvious reasons, people getting sick and dying increases demand in the entire healthcare sector.
2. Post Pandemic – Travel industry will recover, which means GE Aviation demand will rise
3. US  Power grid issues – GE is the OG in this space (remember Edison General  Electric Company? I don't). They laid the foundation for America’s  power grid back before our great grandparents were hipsters.

`SPECULATION ON INFRASTRUCTURE BILL`–JPOW and his goons are on a printing spree. With California fires the  last 6 years and Texas power grid chaos this year, it is OBVIOUS (to me)  we need to UPGRADE OUR POWER GRID INFRASTRUCTURE. What better way to do  that than to inject TRILLIONS into the sector through an INFRASTRUCTURE  BILL, which not only addresses our power problem but generate jobs and  get America back on it’s feet? This means an upgrade to our power grid  to provide more reliable power when we need it the most (i.e weather  extremities) with an emphasis on sustainability and being more eco  friendly (Greta probably approves) . GE is poised to be the biggest  player for this task as they have the capacity and experience to do the  job. On a side note, if an infrastructure bill passes, it’ll be more  than GE that benefits from the bill.

# IS GE THE SAME AS GME?

Not the same, but share some similar characteristics

* Both stock have been beaten down into oblivion (See comparison chart below)
* Before DFV, who the fuck invests in GME? Now, who the fuck invests in GE?
* Both stock have HIGH upside when it is consolidating at the bottom
* Both stock have special external conditions that make it an interesting R / R play
* GME was over shorted and had fresh talent take over from CHEWY
* GE  is in a special moment in US history when an Infrastructure Bill by the  Gov could pave the way for a turnaround for General Electric (more on  that later)

1) BB has nothing to do with smartphones. Throw those 2007 notions out of your mind and bring yourself to the future

2) Whilst the whole stock market has been pissing themselves for years over EV/AV industry speculation, the reality is that these are hardware companies with low margin, and limited scale potential.

Even Tesla, owned and run by the richest man in the world, has yet to build more than 500,000 cars in one year. Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).

THE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst **BB sat at a juicy 10.15%**).

This industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto

u/just an everyday life couldn't have put it better: ""Zombie cars and QNX

QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

SONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations.

3) BB is a cash flow positive, growing company with near nil competitors in an industry that is skyrocketing. Despite this, the boomer fucks who still believe BB is a smartphone company, have in their own glorious act of autism, have massively shorted BB bringing the share price down. 

BB is a growth company in a growth industry, these hedge funds are going to need to borrow more money if they want to buy tendies after the wider market realizes the market inefficiency that is an undervalued BB. u/Tradergurue went into a lot of detail in his $BB short interest post here [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short\_interest\_in\_bb\_its\_increasing/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short_interest_in_bb_its_increasing/) 

TLDR: hedge funds caught with their dicks in their hands are about to get Royally Fucked as the market corrects itself with a BB rise over the next month

TH,"Hello my apes. I recently ate a few of the copper-colored crayons out of a 96-pack, and I'm pretty sure they're laced with Ritalin because I then proceeded to read Kurt Vonnegut's 1959 classic *The Sirens of Titan,* in which he lays out what I can only describe as the most perfect DD I have ever seen. Since I know you don't have books and probably sold all your metallic crayons to buy more $GME (respect), I will lay out the plan for you.

In the book, the main character is the son of a great man, Noel Constant. Noel Constant is a great man, because he turned $8,200 into the largest fortune in the world. How?

He lived in a motel, which contained a copy of the Gideon Bible in the desk drawer. First, he took the first few sentences of that Bible and split it into stonk tickers. So ""In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"" became IN, TH, EB, EG, IN, NI, NG...

Next, he invested all $8,200 into the first stonk, IN, in the list. And what did he do then?

He held. 

He placed a goddamn limit order for double his investment. He didn't fucking paperhands when his stonks were worth 10k. Or 12k. He diamond-handed all the way up to $16,400, and then pulled out all his sweet, sweet tendies.

And then what did he do?

He turned around and put ALL of it into the next one on his list. $16,400 into TH. Which he held until it turned into $32,800.

You get the idea. 

Now, unfortunately there is no ""IN"" ticker. But there is an ""INT"" ticker. World Fuel Services Corp. Which has a strong cashflow and is poised to start making some big gains once people start flying and traveling again. Or so the internet says; it doesn't actually matter since Noel Constant didn't know a fucking thing about his companies when he invested--it's not until he had majority ownership of a company that made spaceships that he started giving a shit about what they actually did. And we ain't at that stage yet.

So here's the play:
1) Invest in INT
2) Diamond Hands until 100% return
3) Sell 
4) Invest into HE
5) Diamond Hands until 100% return
6) Sell
7) Repeat 1-3 for BE, GI, NN, ING, GO, DC, RE, AT...

Even if this plays only half as well as it does in the book, I will be flying around the solar system in a year or two. But I fully expect it to be far more lucrative; after all real life is far stranger than fiction.

ANY," TL/DR: Forbes can suck it. This is my rant. NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE

   
 

I've reconsidered the Forbes article that came out Friday. The more I think about it, the more pissed I've become about the subtle, manipulative, and just plain evil condescension.

   
 

The writer sounded like they were writing a piece complimenting retail investors on our astute comprehension of the numbers. Basically said the little GME investors were NOT just the ignorant peasants that many experts are trying to portray.


SOUNDS GOOD,  RIGHT?



Well, it was just another headfake, y'all. The writer was framing US (retail investors) as the Goliath, not as the underdog, as the David fighting AGAINST the Goliath.

   
 

Its disgusting. These media shills, including FORBES, are just spewing their own GME panic propaganda. And all the so called 'experts' that say retail investors are 'colluding together' have lost their souls.

   
 

When corrupt leaders at Big Hedgies break the law, and swindle the whole world out of their hard earned dollars...when THEY actually collude to destroy companies, and drive down their stock into bankruptcy for their own profit.....guess what. Crickets.

   
 

NOBODY says or does anything about it. Not the media, not the SEC, not the FBI, not the DTCC, an definitely not Congress. The ONLY reason anyone is 'looking' at it, is because us regular people are now AWAKE to the manipulations and the corruption in every segment of our government and financial sectors. They have to 'look like' they are interested in holding somebody accountable. But they aren't really going after the hedgies. They are going after YOU. ME. DFV. Anyone who dares pull back the curtain.

   
 

But when regular people see a good opportunity, and want to invest, LEGALLY, they lose their shit.

   
 

I don't know ANY of you. I don't take advice from anyone here. I read and research and then make my own decisions.

   
 

But dammit, I see a good opportunity, so I've jumped in the deep end of the pool. I've jumped on the proverbial train. And I will ride it to the end of the line.

   
 

I'm gonna be honest, I'm just tired. I'm tired of living on the edge of broke for years.

I just want to be able to finally get my kid braces. To buy myself my good vehicle, or at least fix the one we have. It has 148K miles and is definitely dont feel safe to travel on roadtrips. I dont even like to drive across Houston, just in case the engine light goes on again.

   
 

My credit is not great, so I cant finance a car. (Don't say it. I've already tried. Twice in 18 months. Every time I try again, it tanks my credit further) And since I'm self employed, I don't have a JOB that pays me a regular paycheck. Therefore the ""Your job is your credit"" financing isnt an option either. So YA, Momma wants a car.

   
 

I want to take a family vacation. Hell I want to take a weekend with my husband every once in a while.

   
 

I want to do fun things, and important things like help my kids go to college, IF they want to.

   
 

I want to be able to give a $100 tip to the struggling server, or even provide a fabulous Christmas for some family in need.

   
 

If this makes me a greedy Bitch, I guess I'm a greedy bitch.

   
 

But it DOESNT make me a criminal. It DOESNT mean I am 'scheming' to manipulate the stock market. OR that I am part of a ""premeditated, predatory take-down of a cornered and defenseless counterparty."" as FORBES claims. ell, WE are the cornered, defenseless counterparty, NOT the multi BILLION DOLLAR Hedge funds!

   
 

Are you friggin' KIDDING ME??? My shares, and even ALL the shares we hold as retail investors do NOT have the power to MOVE the market. The BIG institutions are the ones with the power to actually tank the stock or lift the price.

   
 

WE, the reddit investors, are just little ants on a log; riding the roaring waters of the market, hanging on for dear life! And if we HANG ON, then we can make it to the end of this crazy ride, safe and DRY.

   
 

We SEE the end of the journey and are willing to take that journey. Who are these people to say that we are greedy for just jumping on board and risking our money, even maybe our lives, to arrive at the end of that beautiful run?

   
 

Who are they to say we are greedy for just tagging along, for playing THEIR game, the RIGHT way?

Truth is, these hedge funds hold the investments of millions of innocent investors in their hands. And THEY are the ones who have risked these people's fortunes, their very LIVES, playing a rigged game. THEIR greed and corruption has been revealed.

   
 

And I'm sorry if they are freaking out. But its just what happens when you GET CAUGHT.

   
 

TO BE CLEAR: My goal is not to crash the market or to destroy hedge funds, even tho I think some people should go to jail for their illegal activities.

   
 

I just want to ride the rapids. To take the risk and get the payout I know is coming. Not because I know I'm so deserving, but because I know the numbers don't lie. That's not criminal. Its not even shady. Its SMART.

   
 

I will end up in a calm, peaceful lake, surrounded by big beautiful mountains. I will finally be able to enjoy the view. I will send my kids to college, buy those braces, buy safe car, and even go on a beautiful vacation.

   
 

And hey Forbes, hey Cramer. Hey all you crooks investigating DFV.....listen up.

   
 

THATS not greedy. Its INEVITABLE.

   
 

(NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. DO WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANNA DO. I LIKE THE STOCK)

Seriously tho. We are bonded together by a common goal and common struggles. No matter our color, gender, race, religion or political ideology, the real war is against evil and corruption. For the right to pursue our own destinies and our own version of happiness.

PS,"The early lockup period on DASH ends on Tuesday, and DASH is going to fall like a stone. To understand why, first you have to understand (1) how massively over-valued DoorDash is, (2) the factors that have led to this valuation, and (3) why these factors are all going away this week.

&#x200B;

**DASH is massively over-valued, even by meme stock standards**

We all know that many stocks are currently ""over-valued"" according to traditional value metrics. This is especially true of emerging technology stocks, and has been fueled by historically low interest rates and rampant speculation. However, you don't even have to believe that this bubble is going to burst in order to see that DoorDash will fall; ***DASH is massively over-valued even just comparing it to its peers.***

Let's look at DASH's public peers, namely Uber, Lyft, and GrubHub. Now, ride-hailing services are a different business than food delivery, but the technology involved is similar so I believe we can expect similar revenue multiples.

&#x200B;

*Uber:* [\[1\]](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=uber)

*2021 analyst revenue forecast: $16.2B*

*Current market cap: $103.21B*

*Forward P/S forecast: 6.37*

&#x200B;

*Lyft:* [\[2\]](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=lyft)

*2021 analyst revenue forecast: $3.1B*

*Current market cap: $21.09B*

*Forward P/S forecast: 6.8*

&#x200B;

*GrubHub:* [\[3\]](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=grub)

*2021 analyst revenue forecast: $2.2B*

*Current market cap: $5.61B*

*Forward P/S forecast: 2.25*

&#x200B;

*DASH:* [\[4\]](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=dash)

*2021 analyst revenue forecast: $3.7B*

*Current market cap: $48.11B*

*Forward P/S forecast:* ***13.01***

&#x200B;

As you can see, DASH is trading at a **200% higher forward P/S compared to Uber and Lyft!** And a 600% higher forward P/S compared to GrubHub! This is in spite of the fact that Uber and Lyft will still be experiencing a Covid headwind for the first half of 2021, while DoorDash will no longer benefit from the Covid-driven demand surge in the second half of 2021. So 2022 should favor Uber and Lyft even more over DASH.

For DASH to simply come back down to valuation multiples similar to Uber and Lyft, it would need to drop from its current price of \~$150, down to \~**$75.**

&#x200B;

**Covid, a small float, Covid, low interest rates, Covid, and IPO mania have led to this valuation**

The first factor is that DASH currently has a very small float, due to the lockup agreement from the IPO. DoorDash has a total of 286.34M shares outstanding, with only 97.61M currently available for trading [\[6\]](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/dash). 114M more of those shares will be unlocked for trading on Tuesday, as the first of two lockup periods ends (the other lockup period ends in May).

A small float makes it very easy for a stock to be moved up on small volume. DASH only has an average volume of 3.75M. This means that on Tuesday, ***30x the daily volume will be available for sale.***

In addition, DASH IPO'd at the exact right time to fetch an insane valuation. DoorDash raised $400 in a venture capital round in June 2020, at a value of $16B. This would give DASH a share price today of **\~$50.** But Covid caused insane (and temporary) growth in DoorDash's revenue, which drove up excitement in the company. In addition, the IPO markets reached dot-com-bubble levels of froth (the last time IPOs would pop 100% on their first day of trading) this past year. That's why ***DoorDash rushed to IPO at the end of this year*** [\[7\]](https://www.wealthdaily.com/articles/the-rush-to-ipo-before-2020-ends/97862).

&#x200B;

**The bubble is ready to burst**

Life will return to relative normalcy sometime this year. Demand for food delivery services will plummet. At the same time, interest rates are surging higher, which will continue to kill emerging tech growth stocks. The rampant speculation we've seen over the past year will die down soon. I believe DoorDash employees and insiders know (or at least fear) this, and will sell massive quantities of their shares this week as the lockup period expires. 

Keep in mind that this early lockup period only releases **40%** of employees' shares. If you joined DoorDash in 2018 when it was worth only **$1.4B(!)** [\[8\]](https://craft.co/doordash/funding-rounds) and became a multi-multi-millionaire as you saw the market cap of a company that pretty much everybody hates grow **30x** in 2 years, wouldn't you sell 40% of your shares the first time you got the chance?

&#x200B;

2. FINANCIAL calls, in particular I like WFC due to cheap calls. It was in the 50s before COVID reared its ugly head.
3. BABA - beat down by Xi's cockhammer but still absolutely dominant in China. It's the best undervalued tech name (even better than FB in my opinion). BABA also is heavily invested in the China start-up ecosystem, so should do well even with more-than-expected regulation (which I find unlikely)

**Why I like these plays:**

These plays should do well in all 2021 environments.

* Inflation fears due to overstimulus? Oil and financials will do great while BABA, given how cheap it is, will be flat.
* Inflation fears overblown yet reopening moves forward? All 3 should do extremely well.
* New COVID strain renders current vaccines useless -- BABA will do well and oil/financials will be flat. This is just unlikely to happen, boyz. Even with new variants things will continue to open up.

The only way to lose money is if we have a zombie apocalypse.

**Positions**

1. WFC:  June 50c or 45c and sold 4/16 puts to pay for the calls. 1000 shares.
2. BABA: 710 shares -- no options as I don't have a good thesis on WHEN it will moon.
3. XOM, OXY, CPE, MRO, MPC -- various shares and options with different strikes from next month through August. Also selling puts to pay for the calls. 200k into it overall.
