Guys, thanks for all the love on that. Continuing...

We have to understand the bond market or at least have a general idea of what it is. So, no bear scenarios just yet.

**Treasury Bills, Notes, Bonds.**

Just what the hell are they? Give it to me like I’m 8.

They are literally a way for the government to raise capital to use in projects like Covid relief. Not only for negative scenarios but for good ones also, like infrastructure.

**Why different names?**

Treasury Bills: Short term maturity date. Year or less.

Treasury Notes: Mid term maturity date. 2 to 10 years.

Treasury Bonds: Long term maturity date. 10+ to 30 years. Fun fact. They actually thought about issuing 100 year bonds back in 2019. LOL?

**Why they are SOOO important?**

I can’t stress enough how important they are. They're as important as your paycheck to you. On a government scale.

US Bond market is twice as big than the stock market and it trades at a higher volume. Daily. Mostly, investment banks buys them via auctions and offers them to their clients around the world in secondary markets.

I wanna invest in government backed bonds too! You can do that by buying ETFs through ticker symbols like TLT, SHY, SHV etc.

I don’t know why you’d wanna do that but okay. For instance, SHY moved 6 bucks in 15 years 🙄 It wouldn’t make sense for you and I to buy bonds. However, if you have billions of dollars sitting around that 10YR 1.6% yield we’re gonna talk about brings tens of millions backed by ‘Murica. Hell yeah!

**The infamous 10 YEAR TREASURY NOTE YIELD.**

Keeping it simple, not going into Coupon Yields. It’s the interest rate the government pays when it borrows money. Just like your credit card. You use the card, Chase charges you interest.

In our most glorious decade (1990-2000) 10 year treasury yield traded between 5 to 7% compared to 1.6% last Friday. WTF? Yields going up is a good thing for long term economy. They're going up, so what the hell is the problem? Problem is not that they’re going up, it’s how fast they’re going up.

When yields decline, money flows into other equities like stock market with the hopes of better return of investment. Now, when life is normal, this flow or outflow isn’t visible in short term, because yields don’t go up or down drastically in matter of weeks. Until recently.

Putting it in perspective. Here’s an aha moment for you. You keep hearing TSLA stock price is overvalued, P/E ratio at 140x hurrr...durrrr...That’s because money got poured into growth stocks like TSLA and AMZN the last decade due to declining yields. What sector is the most promising in terms of future growth? Tech. When yields spiked in matter of weeks, tech took a big shit. Because it was the most “leveraged” sector. Just look at this goddam chart. It’s crazy.

My apologies for not delivering **Bear Scenarios** tonight. I am six beers into a beautiful Sunday weather and I'd like to take my time making a solid bear case. We've at least established how important bond market is and how it controls the entire economy. It'd make a good case when SPY hits 400 in about 18 hours. Oh by the way, I think 10 Year Treasury bond will get close to 3% by Christmas and shit's gonna hit the fan.

Obligatory, I didn't wear a helmet growing up, so I'm not qualified to give financial advice. I just like the stock.

My position: I'm in for a bit over 2,500 shares and 211 calls.

This is going to be a two-tiered DD that will focus on the very near term (this week) and a bit longer time frame.

I've written a bit about this in my past NOK DD posts, but I want to give just a small look at it again, as this week is shaping up to be incredibly wild with Nokia. Aside from the already astronomical OI on call contracts, we have two catalysts that will come into play this week. The first is stimulus money. As we all know by now, that sweet sweet government money is going to start hitting accounts today and over the next few days. Now, IDGAF what you do with that money, but we already know that a massive amount is gonna go straight into the market:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=c0bdae93936a](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=c0bdae93936a)

Why that is especially important for NOK. NOK is currently the #1 stock on Robinhood, a frequent top 20 stock here, and around 100k watchers on another platform (not sure if we can mention it here or not). Needless to say, NOK has more retail eyeballs on it than pretty much any other stock except for GME, AMC, and a handful of the other big boys (TSLA / FAANG / ETC). So, you tracking me....stimi money make NOK go 🚀🚀🚀.

The second catalyst is Nokia's Capital Market Day event taking place on 3/18. If you want any more information on that, you can scroll through my post history. I'll sum it up. CMD could be a paradigm altering event for Nokia. Their new CEO has been aggressive with increasing FCF, and it's working. They are now seeing great cash flow increases even during COVID. This puts them in a position to either increase buybacks, reinstate dividends, or invest heavily into R&D to take over 5G/ be a frontrunner for 6G.

This all leads me to the wild options chain expiring next Friday. At this point, if you don't know what a gamma squeeze is, then I can't really do anything for you. This last week was huge as we went from well under $4, to well over it. That completely changed the ball game on 42k option contracts at the $4 strike. It put them well ITM, drastically increasing the delta on the options. Now that they are well ITM, the delta on those (currently .7433) will only increase as we draw closer to expiry. The next strike is $4.50 and we have around 26k OI on those. Gamma and Delta on these are currently .7260 and .3078, respectively. I'm curious what kind of action we see Monday PM. This week is looking like it's going to shape up like the wild week back in January. That week NOK closed on Friday at $4.20, and this Friday it closed at $4.21. The Monday of that week, NOK basically gapped to $4.75 and started it's wild ride. If that happens again, or if we see any movement closer to $4.50 early in the week, things will get wild.

**The ""finish line"" on the craziness is the $5 calls.** There is currently 133k OI at the $5 strike. This is an absolutely mind boggling amount of calls open this close to expiry. Currently, they are essentially worthless with a bid at .03 at close on Friday. However, if we see stimulus money poured in and any sort of positive rumors preCMD, we could see the price action of NOK drift towards $4.75-4.90. At this point, the gamma squeeze begins on those $5 calls, and could set off a wild ride. I don't foresee something like what happened back in January happening again, but all of the catalysts are there to make it happen again...if not more this time around. It really all stems around CMD. If they come out with some wildly positive news, this thing could explode.

Bonus...there is another 64k OI @ $6, 53k @ $7, and 45k @ $8, to keep the ride going.

**2. Relevant news since my last DD Post**

I thought a lot about not posting another DD post, but I just feel the news is coming so fast and often with Nokia lately, that someone should at least compile the big pieces together and post them here for the sub's benefit. I won't add much too much commentary on each piece.

First, the FCC reiterated their stance on Huawei and ZTE as security risks. IMO, this is a big one. It shows that the administration isn't going to stray away from the previous one's stance on the Chinese 5G companies. This gives Nokia, Ericsson, and Samsung a few more years to develop an oligopoly in the US market.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-tech-idINKBN2B5022](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-tech-idINKBN2B5022)

Second, in the same vein as the previous one. It looks like India is going to institute a Huawei ban.

[https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/11/india-may-block-chinas-huawei-over-security-fears-officials](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/11/india-may-block-chinas-huawei-over-security-fears-officials)

Lastly, Samsung and Nokia signed a deal for Samsung to pay royalties to Nokia for a patent license. This one doesn't have anything to do with 5G, but something to do with video standards. The bigger piece in this one is Samsung's apparent rift with Ericsson. If Samsung needs access to some sort of 5G patent, it appears they are more wiling to play ball with Nokia than Ericsson. It also shows how wide Nokia's patent landscape is.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-patent-samsung/nokia-signs-patent-license-pact-with-samsung-idUSKBN2B30ML](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-patent-samsung/nokia-signs-patent-license-pact-with-samsung-idUSKBN2B30ML)

There are so many more things that I'm looking out for on the Nokia front. Here is a very short list:

\- What other countries will institute Huawei/ZTE bans. At this point it appears it's going to be a China vs. the world battle when it comes to 5G/Data infrastructure.

\- Either at CMD, the annual meeting in April, or the next ER we should get an update on their ReefShark delivery percentage. It is their top KPI as a company. The higher % of ReefShark they have across the network, the more profitable their networks segment becomes.

\- Can they keep increasing FCF in the next few ERs? Kind of tied into ReefShark and a ton of other factors.

\- What kind of contracts does the US DoD sign with Nokia in the near future?They were part of the $600M deal back in the fall of last year, and at this point it looks like the government wants to work with either NOK/ERIC for that kind of buildout.

\- Will we see some sort of stimulus in order to build out 5G networks in the US/EU? Goes back to my China vs. everybody point earlier. I'd like to see the FCC utilize the massive haul they got in the latest spectrum auction to provide grants or some sort of funding to the telco companies to actually build out the networks in those spectrums.

Lastly, if anyone makes a comment about the float being a hinderance to NOK's ability to move, I will buy them an all expense paid trip to the Crayola factory. I will send an email to the CEO, and ask them to work with you to create a new color. It will be called, ""WSB Short Bus Yellow"". Nearly 3B shares were traded in one week back in January, and it could have been more if not for RH and other brokers shutting it down. There are way more than enough retail and institutional eyeballs on Nokia to see the volume it needs in order to move.

TL:DR - NOK's CMD event on 3/18 could cause a massive gamma squeeze with nearly 200k OI on calls ITM or close to being ITM. Stimi money pumping in this week with tons of retail eyeballs on NOK sets up for what could be an extremely interesting week. We almost saw $10 print in January, and all the factors, if not more, are in play this week.",$NOK (Nokia) DD. Big week ahead with other recent news.

I wanted to share my DD on a company I am very bullish on $HIMS. An incoming catalyst in the form of year end 2020 earnings is set to be announced 3/18. This was trading in the 20s in February. There’s one thing people want to do....look better and have sex! Even boomers 

**About the company**

Hims & Hers Health is a is a fast growing telehealth and mail order wellness product provider. The company launched in 2017 targeting the male consumer hair regrowth and erectile dysfunction markets (my wife’s BF sometimes needs a little help \*wink wink\*) A few months later, Hers, their female health company was launched offering birth control, skin care, and hair care products.

&#x200B;

**Financial Analysis**Below are some key financial takeaways and indicators. HIMS has done a great job at retaining customers while also managing its cost to acquire them (see next section)

* Estimated 128% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2018 to 2020
* 91% recurring revenue
* 71% gross margins
* Over 2 million cumulative consultations
* More than 250,000 customer subscriptions
* Sales increase expectations are 66% increase to 138 million for 2020

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**

In subscription based business models, acquiring customers is an extremely costly aspect. In 2019, HIMS spent over 150 million on CAC. Through the first 2 quarters of 2020 they only spend 17 million (graph below). Keeping the same trajectory for year end 2020 would result in a 75% decrease.

Haven’t really been keeping up with WSB lately due to all the meme hype, so hopefully this isn’t repetitive of anything people have said lately. As you know, FOMC is coming up this week on the 16th and 17th. The Federal Reserve will post the changes on the ~~16th~~ 17th (Wednesday-shout out datguypete for catching that) at 2 PM EST. I did a quick browse on WSB to make sure this post wasn’t repetitive, and saw a few things explaining FOMC/YCC/SLR and potentially devastating effects, but I did not find anything regarding how to profit each of the 4 scenarios. Most seemed like doomsday posts, but I'm here to tell you, no matter the outcome of the FOMC, you can profit obesely. Not fat profits. *Obese profits.*

**I’ve explained below the 4 different scenarios and outcomes of the FOMC and what to play in regards to those outcomes. If you don’t want to read this, I’ll put a TLDR cheat sheet at the bottom.**

My final paragraph includes GME and AMC for those of you who bear so much sexual aggression to those stocks that society should not allow you to be out in public due to the *safety of others.*

If you haven’t kept up with everything regarding treasuries and the SLR policy, I’ll try and fill you in without you having to know the finance technicals and what not. This is not a doomsday post so don’t throw a tantrum when I mention bubbles which beginsssss *now* -&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Right now we currently are in every bubble possible, but certain ones are more important to keep going instead of other ones (to save face). J Pow has been kicking the can further and further to hold off the inevitable, ultimately making things worse each time he does it. There’s a few different types of bubbles: market (housing in this case), commodity, stock market, credit bubble, economy bubble. Asset inflation is very profitable for the wealthy, and for those who know how to use it to their advantage, which is why Wall Street wants the economy and stock market to overheat. On the other hand, asset inflation destroys those who cannot afford assets, as they won't be able to buy a home, a car, or invest, because that inflation seeps into necessities, leaving them no money to invest and get ahead. Which is why the wealth gap rapidly expanded during covid to levels unseen since the lead up to the 1929 crash.

**Types of Bubbles:**

**Commodities** 

Moon during inflation (lumber, oil, coffee, copper, sugar, etc). Most likely won’t see this crash until later on. Because this is the final stage of inflation before prices begin to inflate groceries which is a big influence on CPI. Things like sugar and coffee beans increase the price of groceries that include those ingredients. 
The Federal Reserve goes off the CPI when reporting inflation, and even changes the rules when they publish them, to keep CPI down. We’ve been locked up, so the massive money injections are found in assets, such as the housing market, commodities, and the stock market. All this asset inflation will eventually spill over to CPI, and when that happens, the Fed will increase their rates, popping everything. The trickle begins to grow into a pour the more the economy opens up.

**Housing bubble**

Residential real estate in this case, although commercial are on the rise (they took a massive hit when covid hit unlike residential because WFH/Stimmys/Low mortgage rates, while offices and commercial buildings closed down).  Commercial real estate isn’t a bubble yet, but since prices were historically low, and real estate inflation is building fast, i believe these will rise the fastest (VNQ is very lucrative, it also just closed above major resistance Friday). Most likely won’t let this crash until end of summer or during the fall.

**Stock market** 

Very clear and everybody knows it, but it’s not about if, it’s about when. Unlikely they’ll let it fail right now. Most likely won’t crash until end of summer or during the fall. A crash of the stock market would mean people panicking about their life savings, and saving their money, rather than spend it in the reopening of the economy.

**Credit Bubble** 

QE, low fed rates, stimulus, credit forbearance, student loan forbearance, rent forbearance, etc all built the credit bubble. Probably won’t let this fall because it’ll be mayhem, and will lead to the pop of all the other bubbles. Although, the rent moratorium ending March 31st might exacerbate the credit bubble, paired with no more stimulus forecasted in the future.

**Economic bubble**

Related to the concept of market bubbles is the idea of a general economic boom. A boom implies that the economy expands at an unsustainably fast rate, leading to inflation (e.g. aggregate demand grows faster than productive capacity). Ultimately an economic boom usually proves unsustainable. There may be a strong link between market bubbles and an economic boom. For example, a house price bubble may cause rising wealth and confidence leading to higher consumer spending and economic growth. In turn, the higher economic growth feeds the housing boom. Clearly they won’t let this pop right now because we’re finally reopening. Even though reopening will exacerbate it immensely.


So as you can see, we’re in quite a pickle. A lot comes down to FOMC.


**Things to watch at FOMC:**

**Yield Curve Control**

Increases our debt tremendously adding to inflation. Lowers yields on treasuries that have been mooning lately, as they vastly increase the amount of bonds they buy to decrease the yield. We’re already doing this somewhat, as the Fed spends $120b a month on bonds.

**Supplementary Leverage Ratio** 

When covid first caused havoc, the Federal Reserve eased the leverage rules for large banks by exempting certain investments from their leverage calculations. If that sentence sounds like pig Latin to you don’t worry it doesn’t matter if you understand it, what matters is how to make money off the policy extension/ending. The banks were able to exempt any holdings in U.S. Treasury debt or deposits at the Fed from their calculations of the supplementary leverage ratio. It was supposed to end March 31st. Everybody thought that was the plan. J Pow even said a few months back they have no plans of extending it. But then the yields began to rise and fast. 

Recently, J Pow shocked the public by hinting they might extend the SLR, or potentially make it permanent. They can’t afford to do YCC (they might anyways because they have a trend of positive short term outlook at the cost of long term growth), so if they get rid of SLR without YCC, more than likely every bubble pops. Not extending SLR means that every bank potentially sells off over a trillion dollars in treasuries, skyrocketing the yields, causing a huge tech sell off, and more than likely bringing the entire market with it, popping the stock market bubble. Mortgage rates move with the 10 year treasury, so mortgage rates skyrocket, popping the housing bubble. A popped housing bubble, will pop the credit bubble. And so on. Eventually sending us into a catastrophe worse than the covid recession (if you want to call that a recession), and potentially worse than the Great Depression. Higher yields means that the debt the Federal Reserve has put themselves in, becomes more costly, and the Federal Reserve and the United States government will become bankrupt and default on the debts we owe to foreign countries. However, lots of people on Capitol Hill are begging the Federal Reserve to not extend it, because SLR is one of the most important regulations for Wall Street to not take advantage of the average Joe, and was implemented after the 2008 crisis. The relaxed SLR covid policy is the reason why the wealth gap grew to levels unseen since 1929 (right before the Great Depression) during Covid.

Rather than fearing inflation and moving to cash (which is dumb as hell if there’s inflation on the rise, because your money becomes less valuable by the minute), use it to your advantage.

**4 scenarios and how to play them:**

**YCC implemented, and SLR is extended**

Play REIT ETFs (i have calls on VNQ expiring Friday that i bought at close last Friday). I might sell before the FOMC. The combo of both of these means inflation dramatically goes up, while yields will become incredibly suppressed, keeping real estate prices inflating, and mortgage rates low. Can also begin playing speculative technology again. I’d be cautious tho. Because there’s a chance people start selling bonds faster than YCC and SLR can support it. Collapsing the whole bond system, wiping 80%+ off of Nasdaq. J.P. Morgan predicted a minimum crash of 20% if the 10 year treasury yield hits 2.00%.

**YCC not implemented, but SLR is extended**

Yields might continue to rise, but not as fast as if YCC and SLR were both off the table. Probably could diversify with commodities and REIT. This one will be the least volatile and markets will probably continue to rise for a bit but slowly. This is the current state we’re in. Yields are still dramatically rising, but not as fast as they would with SLR being shot down. I’d play blue chips and value stocks IMO as well. If yields continue to rise, I’d begin shorting QQQ with puts, because once the 10 year hits 2.00%, there will be at least a 20% correction on the Nasdaq. I’d start buying puts around the 1.85% yield mark.

**YCC not implemented, and SLR is not extended**

Hold on to your seat belts. Yields are going through the absolute roof. Buy puts on TLT and make a fortune. Out of all the profit calculations on options I’ve ever done in history, this one is by far the most lucrative in terms of potential. Yields rise as bonds sell off. The lack of YCC and SLR will cause a massive sell of on bonds and potentially cause a gamma squeeze downwards. I’m talking 10k worth of puts being worth tens of millions in a months time.

**YCC implemented, and SLR not extended**

Massive increase in inflation, yields will probably go down. Commodities play. Don’t buy precious metals, because they’re not based off anything anymore. And they’re heavily manipulated. Buy ITB puts (home construction) and calls on commodity ETFs. Lumber will continue to skyrocket to the point that home builders will have to charge insane prices due to supply cost, leading to dramatically less demand. It’s currently forming a head and shoulders on the 1 month chart. Also the moratorium ends March 31st as well, leading to foreclosures. This will increase the supply of available homes on the market, thus, even less demand for home builders.

I personally believe the market wide crash will not happen until the economy is fully up and running, leading to a severe overheating of the economy. This is will cause the federal reserve to finally increase their rates once the CPI is finally hit hard. This is the catalyst for popping the mother of all bubbles. Might happen at the June FOMC, but more than likely it’ll be at the July, September, or November one. I think the highest probability is the September FOMC. Although, congress has to decide on the debt ceiling situation by July, and if the raising is rejected, that’ll cause the pop. Build up that capital by playing the policies to your advantage until then. Once you’ve built up enormous capital, you can buy puts on the SPY and ride around in your private jet safely while the country is up in flames.

In short, **do not place your bets in terms of the market**. Place your bets on the **feds policies** and **how those policies affect the overall markets**, and more importantly, the **subcategories** of the markets. Watch the ventriloquist (Fed), not the puppet (markets). Individual stocks are subject to manipulation, but ETFs are harder, as it’s harder and riskier to manipulate all the stocks in the industry. Which is why I do options on ETFs, rather than individual stocks. Just watch out for dividend risk. Many platforms don’t inform you that you have to pay dividends of those contracts to the contract seller, and those costs aren’t included in the contract costs. A 3% dividend might not seem like a lot, but remember, each contract is equivalent to 100 shares.

Hopefully this helps y’all. There’s money to be made in every market. When one market goes down, another one rises. If you can’t find it, keep looking. If there’s an off chance of literally no bull market (highly unlikely), flip the chart upside down and your calls now become puts.

AMC/GME will probably be profitable this week, but there WILL be a rug pull. Smart money vs dumb money ultimately comes down to the risk/reward ratio. Dumb money focuses more on the reward side, while smart money is focuses on the risk side. Set stop losses and realistic price targets (realistic for GameStop, as I believe it can multiply in price multiple times this week. Clearly, thinking Apple will multiply in price this week would be very unrealistic). Hedge funds are buying in as well. They see dumb money flooding the system and can profit off of it. Watch the volume in real time. Short and rapid volume rises means retail investors, large instantaneous leaps means institutions are buying. When they sell, the price squeezes downwards, as stop losses get triggered.

**TLDR;**

YCC implemented, SLR extended: calls on REIT ETFs (VNQ)

YCC implemented, SLR not extended: ITB puts (home construction etf), calls on commodities (CPER, PDBC, GSG)

YCC not implemented, SLR extended: stonks go sideways, diversify with calls on REIT and commodities (not precious metals) (lumber/sugar/coffee/copper)

YCC not implemented, SLR not extended: yields moon/potential market crash. Buy puts on TLT (20 year bond prices crater and fast)

If you want to make big money fast, print/make a cheat sheet of those 4 TLDR plays while watching the FOMC live. Set up your trade drafts in different tabs so all you have to do is click a button and beat the herd. If they announce one of the policies first, you can close out half of the plays, leaving only two tabs. I suspect we’ll do YCC not implemented and SLR extended, as it’ll slow the rise in yields, and also not cause massive volatility. Markets will be calm and the Federal Reserve lives to see another day.

One ^more thing^:

There is a potential for a market crash during quad witching hour, regardless of the outcome of FOMC. Wall Street might doing a massive rotation from growth to value. This could plummet the value of growth stocks very quickly, setting off stop losses. If this happens, people could panic sell and it could snowball, bringing down the entire market with it. I don't believe there is a big chance of that, but there is a chance. I think it'll stabilize after a few trading days, but I thought I'd throw that out there.

If I'm wrong or misinformed about anything in the post, please comment below. Or if you have some tips on some plays regarding one of the 4 scenarios, let me know. *Let's make these tendies.*

**EDIT (because y’all keep messaging me and commenting about one of them going down or wanting to yolo into one) -**

**My positions for this week: **

$135 3/19 TLT Puts

$65 3/19 ITB Puts

$95 3/19 VNQ Calls

**TLT and ITB are betting that FOMC causes a spike in yields.**

**VNQ is my hedge if I’m wrong and yields fall.**

If yields spike, good, I make a lot of money. If yields fall, good, I still make enough to cover the expenses of the others expiring worthless, while still making profits. Stop messaging me laughing that one of the three are down, I know at least one will go down, that’s the whole fucking point of hedging.

*And no, those 3 positions aren’t my entire account. Even though I diversified, it’s only about a tenth of my portfolio. It’s very important to have the humility to admit to yourself that no matter how much time and effort you put into research, there’s still a possibility you could be wrong. There’s no such thing as a sure thing. If you think something is a for sure thing, it’s almost a for sure thing that you’re wrong. I’ve been burned too many times over the past years to risk a big portion of my portfolio on weeklys. I still manage my risks, no matter how big the potential reward is, and how little the potential risk may seem.*

Diversifying and hedging are still very important. I know y’all think diversifying is boomer shit, but when it comes to options it’s important. If you want to yolo into one, at least do long strangles. If your erection is pointing towards a certain direction, at least do a 2:1 ratio for strangles (having a ratio of 2 calls for every put for bullish, or having 2 puts for every call for bearish). Focus on preserving what you have. An almost certain 50% profit a week is way more lucrative over time than a low chance of 300%+ profit on a yolo. Understand greeks and what they mean. 

**Understand that stocks don’t move because of good news or bad news, they move because institutions want them to move aka low gamma (or not move if they sold strangles aka high gamma [keeps price action sideways rather than up or down]). They gamma hedge and delta hedge. They can literally rig the game by buying calls, selling puts, and then using billions to push the stock upwards, making profits off the puts they sold expiring worthless, making money off the calls they bought because they expire deep ITM, and profiting off the underlying stock they bought because of impulse waves and gamma squeezes from the people who sold them those calls.** 

**Don’t complain about how the game is rigged, think like an institution and figure out how to profit off of it. If you want to preach to your politicians to fix it and change laws and make it fair, you will be wasting your time and energy and will end up broke and depressed. Leave that to the social justice warriors. Look back over the past decade. Social media is flooded with them. All that time and energy and not a single thing has changed. I know because I’ve been there when it comes to complaining the game is rigged. It took years for it to finally click for me. And now I’m making money.**

Understand that and IV and set yourself up for success. If you use TDA’s ThinkOrSwim, you can use option screeners to find options that are near the money with phenomenal gamma and IV levels. Pair that with research on current events and macroeconomics to figure out which stock options are the correct puzzle piece for the puzzle you’re solving. 

Boomers diversify by buying stocks in all areas. Which is dumb. Because when one market goes up, another probably takes a hit. Those profits are very slow. This is very different. We’re intensely focused on two areas, which are yields and debt. This week has a massive impact on those two areas, primarily the yields. We expect big movement either upwards or downwards in yields, that’s why playing both sides works. Because even on the hedge, the movement that direction will be big enough to cover expenses and still come out with profit.

I’ve been on WSB for years. This account has only been posting here for about a year and a half, but I had another Reddit i deleted when I was in the market for a new job. I know some of the OGs here will roast you for not taking the route of high risk high reward. It’s the culture that’s been here, and will always be here. Loss porn is funny, and gain porn makes you aroused. But both of those types of posts have a very important meaning behind it, and that’s to keep your feet on the ground, but your eyes to the stars. 

Per the words of Billy Joel on Vienna, 

“Dream big, but don’t imagine they all come true. When will you realize, Vienna waits for you.” 

That song has made huge impacts on almost every aspect of my life, especially investing.

For every person I see on here who have changed their entire life with the gains they’ve made, I’ve watched the same amount of people lose more than they could afford. I’ve watched newbies get burned bad and promise to themselves that they’ll never touch stocks again, and they don’t. I’ve watched newbies get burned so bad and become depressed, and their posts signal a call for help. I lost four close friends to suicide my final year of college in 2018. I don’t want that to happen to any of you. I want you to shrink the ranges of the highs and lows. Just like taking too much of a certain substance, those high highs feel very good, but when the very low lows come around, you realize the highs weren’t worth the lows in the end. And more importantly, I want you to be able to continue investing throughout your life. Though, the dynamics and culture has changed quite a bit since 9m people joined, I welcome all of you to the group. Even if I miss what this subreddit used to be, I’m excited and optimistic about the future of WSB. If you’re eager to help this subreddit in any way possible, educate yourself on the market, the past/present/future global events and news, and do your own research that expands beyond the horizon of GME and AMC. Keep the shilling to a minimum, and back up all your posts with evidence. We’ve all been in group projects before. We know that it sucks when only one person does all the work, while the others run around like idiots. Strive to make this subreddit an effective group project, where everybody helps pull their own weight. And also, keep posting those dank memes and drinking your own piss. Group projects are worth it when the group gets fucked up together after the work is all finished.

Good luck on your journeys, my messages are always open for advice. Don’t come in asking where you should throw your money into, I won’t respond. But if you ask questions on what to study, and my thoughts on certain trade ideas, or if you need someone to talk to, I’ll respond.

1615761604.0,QQQ,"**How to play FOMC this week**

Haven’t really been keeping up with WSB lately due to all the meme hype, so hopefully this isn’t repetitive of anything people have said lately. As you know, FOMC is coming up this week on the 16th and 17th. The Federal Reserve will post the changes on the ~~16th~~ 17th (Wednesday-shout out datguypete for catching that) at 2 PM EST. I did a quick browse on WSB to make sure this post wasn’t repetitive, and saw a few things explaining FOMC/YCC/SLR and potentially devastating effects, but I did not find anything regarding how to profit each of the 4 scenarios. Most seemed like doomsday posts, but I'm here to tell you, no matter the outcome of the FOMC, you can profit obesely. Not fat profits. *Obese profits.*

**I’ve explained below the 4 different scenarios and outcomes of the FOMC and what to play in regards to those outcomes. If you don’t want to read this, I’ll put a TLDR cheat sheet at the bottom.**

My final paragraph includes GME and AMC for those of you who bear so much sexual aggression to those stocks that society should not allow you to be out in public due to the *safety of others.*

If you haven’t kept up with everything regarding treasuries and the SLR policy, I’ll try and fill you in without you having to know the finance technicals and what not. This is not a doomsday post so don’t throw a tantrum when I mention bubbles which beginsssss *now* -&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Right now we currently are in every bubble possible, but certain ones are more important to keep going instead of other ones (to save face). J Pow has been kicking the can further and further to hold off the inevitable, ultimately making things worse each time he does it. There’s a few different types of bubbles: market (housing in this case), commodity, stock market, credit bubble, economy bubble. Asset inflation is very profitable for the wealthy, and for those who know how to use it to their advantage, which is why Wall Street wants the economy and stock market to overheat. On the other hand, asset inflation destroys those who cannot afford assets, as they won't be able to buy a home, a car, or invest, because that inflation seeps into necessities, leaving them no money to invest and get ahead. Which is why the wealth gap rapidly expanded during covid to levels unseen since the lead up to the 1929 crash.

**Types of Bubbles:**

**Commodities** 

Moon during inflation (lumber, oil, coffee, copper, sugar, etc). Most likely won’t see this crash until later on. Because this is the final stage of inflation before prices begin to inflate groceries which is a big influence on CPI. Things like sugar and coffee beans increase the price of groceries that include those ingredients. 
The Federal Reserve goes off the CPI when reporting inflation, and even changes the rules when they publish them, to keep CPI down. We’ve been locked up, so the massive money injections are found in assets, such as the housing market, commodities, and the stock market. All this asset inflation will eventually spill over to CPI, and when that happens, the Fed will increase their rates, popping everything. The trickle begins to grow into a pour the more the economy opens up.

**Housing bubble**

Residential real estate in this case, although commercial are on the rise (they took a massive hit when covid hit unlike residential because WFH/Stimmys/Low mortgage rates, while offices and commercial buildings closed down).  Commercial real estate isn’t a bubble yet, but since prices were historically low, and real estate inflation is building fast, i believe these will rise the fastest (VNQ is very lucrative, it also just closed above major resistance Friday). Most likely won’t let this crash until end of summer or during the fall.

**Stock market** 

Very clear and everybody knows it, but it’s not about if, it’s about when. Unlikely they’ll let it fail right now. Most likely won’t crash until end of summer or during the fall. A crash of the stock market would mean people panicking about their life savings, and saving their money, rather than spend it in the reopening of the economy.

**Credit Bubble** 

QE, low fed rates, stimulus, credit forbearance, student loan forbearance, rent forbearance, etc all built the credit bubble. Probably won’t let this fall because it’ll be mayhem, and will lead to the pop of all the other bubbles. Although, the rent moratorium ending March 31st might exacerbate the credit bubble, paired with no more stimulus forecasted in the future.

**Economic bubble**

Related to the concept of market bubbles is the idea of a general economic boom. A boom implies that the economy expands at an unsustainably fast rate, leading to inflation (e.g. aggregate demand grows faster than productive capacity). Ultimately an economic boom usually proves unsustainable. There may be a strong link between market bubbles and an economic boom. For example, a house price bubble may cause rising wealth and confidence leading to higher consumer spending and economic growth. In turn, the higher economic growth feeds the housing boom. Clearly they won’t let this pop right now because we’re finally reopening. Even though reopening will exacerbate it immensely.


So as you can see, we’re in quite a pickle. A lot comes down to FOMC.


**Things to watch at FOMC:**

**Yield Curve Control**

Increases our debt tremendously adding to inflation. Lowers yields on treasuries that have been mooning lately, as they vastly increase the amount of bonds they buy to decrease the yield. We’re already doing this somewhat, as the Fed spends $120b a month on bonds.

**Supplementary Leverage Ratio** 

When covid first caused havoc, the Federal Reserve eased the leverage rules for large banks by exempting certain investments from their leverage calculations. If that sentence sounds like pig Latin to you don’t worry it doesn’t matter if you understand it, what matters is how to make money off the policy extension/ending. The banks were able to exempt any holdings in U.S. Treasury debt or deposits at the Fed from their calculations of the supplementary leverage ratio. It was supposed to end March 31st. Everybody thought that was the plan. J Pow even said a few months back they have no plans of extending it. But then the yields began to rise and fast. 

Recently, J Pow shocked the public by hinting they might extend the SLR, or potentially make it permanent. They can’t afford to do YCC (they might anyways because they have a trend of positive short term outlook at the cost of long term growth), so if they get rid of SLR without YCC, more than likely every bubble pops. Not extending SLR means that every bank potentially sells off over a trillion dollars in treasuries, skyrocketing the yields, causing a huge tech sell off, and more than likely bringing the entire market with it, popping the stock market bubble. Mortgage rates move with the 10 year treasury, so mortgage rates skyrocket, popping the housing bubble. A popped housing bubble, will pop the credit bubble. And so on. Eventually sending us into a catastrophe worse than the covid recession (if you want to call that a recession), and potentially worse than the Great Depression. Higher yields means that the debt the Federal Reserve has put themselves in, becomes more costly, and the Federal Reserve and the United States government will become bankrupt and default on the debts we owe to foreign countries. However, lots of people on Capitol Hill are begging the Federal Reserve to not extend it, because SLR is one of the most important regulations for Wall Street to not take advantage of the average Joe, and was implemented after the 2008 crisis. The relaxed SLR covid policy is the reason why the wealth gap grew to levels unseen since 1929 (right before the Great Depression) during Covid.

Rather than fearing inflation and moving to cash (which is dumb as hell if there’s inflation on the rise, because your money becomes less valuable by the minute), use it to your advantage.

**4 scenarios and how to play them:**

**YCC implemented, and SLR is extended**

Play REIT ETFs (i have calls on VNQ expiring Friday that i bought at close last Friday). I might sell before the FOMC. The combo of both of these means inflation dramatically goes up, while yields will become incredibly suppressed, keeping real estate prices inflating, and mortgage rates low. Can also begin playing speculative technology again. I’d be cautious tho. Because there’s a chance people start selling bonds faster than YCC and SLR can support it. Collapsing the whole bond system, wiping 80%+ off of Nasdaq. J.P. Morgan predicted a minimum crash of 20% if the 10 year treasury yield hits 2.00%.

**YCC not implemented, but SLR is extended**

Yields might continue to rise, but not as fast as if YCC and SLR were both off the table. Probably could diversify with commodities and REIT. This one will be the least volatile and markets will probably continue to rise for a bit but slowly. This is the current state we’re in. Yields are still dramatically rising, but not as fast as they would with SLR being shot down. I’d play blue chips and value stocks IMO as well. If yields continue to rise, I’d begin shorting QQQ with puts, because once the 10 year hits 2.00%, there will be at least a 20% correction on the Nasdaq. I’d start buying puts around the 1.85% yield mark.

**YCC not implemented, and SLR is not extended**

Hold on to your seat belts. Yields are going through the absolute roof. Buy puts on TLT and make a fortune. Out of all the profit calculations on options I’ve ever done in history, this one is by far the most lucrative in terms of potential. Yields rise as bonds sell off. The lack of YCC and SLR will cause a massive sell of on bonds and potentially cause a gamma squeeze downwards. I’m talking 10k worth of puts being worth tens of millions in a months time.

**YCC implemented, and SLR not extended**

Massive increase in inflation, yields will probably go down. Commodities play. Don’t buy precious metals, because they’re not based off anything anymore. And they’re heavily manipulated. Buy ITB puts (home construction) and calls on commodity ETFs. Lumber will continue to skyrocket to the point that home builders will have to charge insane prices due to supply cost, leading to dramatically less demand. It’s currently forming a head and shoulders on the 1 month chart. Also the moratorium ends March 31st as well, leading to foreclosures. This will increase the supply of available homes on the market, thus, even less demand for home builders.

I personally believe the market wide crash will not happen until the economy is fully up and running, leading to a severe overheating of the economy. This is will cause the federal reserve to finally increase their rates once the CPI is finally hit hard. This is the catalyst for popping the mother of all bubbles. Might happen at the June FOMC, but more than likely it’ll be at the July, September, or November one. I think the highest probability is the September FOMC. Although, congress has to decide on the debt ceiling situation by July, and if the raising is rejected, that’ll cause the pop. Build up that capital by playing the policies to your advantage until then. Once you’ve built up enormous capital, you can buy puts on the SPY and ride around in your private jet safely while the country is up in flames.

In short, **do not place your bets in terms of the market**. Place your bets on the **feds policies** and **how those policies affect the overall markets**, and more importantly, the **subcategories** of the markets. Watch the ventriloquist (Fed), not the puppet (markets). Individual stocks are subject to manipulation, but ETFs are harder, as it’s harder and riskier to manipulate all the stocks in the industry. Which is why I do options on ETFs, rather than individual stocks. Just watch out for dividend risk. Many platforms don’t inform you that you have to pay dividends of those contracts to the contract seller, and those costs aren’t included in the contract costs. A 3% dividend might not seem like a lot, but remember, each contract is equivalent to 100 shares.

Hopefully this helps y’all. There’s money to be made in every market. When one market goes down, another one rises. If you can’t find it, keep looking. If there’s an off chance of literally no bull market (highly unlikely), flip the chart upside down and your calls now become puts.

AMC/GME will probably be profitable this week, but there WILL be a rug pull. Smart money vs dumb money ultimately comes down to the risk/reward ratio. Dumb money focuses more on the reward side, while smart money is focuses on the risk side. Set stop losses and realistic price targets (realistic for GameStop, as I believe it can multiply in price multiple times this week. Clearly, thinking Apple will multiply in price this week would be very unrealistic). Hedge funds are buying in as well. They see dumb money flooding the system and can profit off of it. Watch the volume in real time. Short and rapid volume rises means retail investors, large instantaneous leaps means institutions are buying. When they sell, the price squeezes downwards, as stop losses get triggered.

**TLDR;**

YCC implemented, SLR extended: calls on REIT ETFs (VNQ)

YCC implemented, SLR not extended: ITB puts (home construction etf), calls on commodities (CPER, PDBC, GSG)

YCC not implemented, SLR extended: stonks go sideways, diversify with calls on REIT and commodities (not precious metals) (lumber/sugar/coffee/copper)

YCC not implemented, SLR not extended: yields moon/potential market crash. Buy puts on TLT (20 year bond prices crater and fast)

If you want to make big money fast, print/make a cheat sheet of those 4 TLDR plays while watching the FOMC live. Set up your trade drafts in different tabs so all you have to do is click a button and beat the herd. If they announce one of the policies first, you can close out half of the plays, leaving only two tabs. I suspect we’ll do YCC not implemented and SLR extended, as it’ll slow the rise in yields, and also not cause massive volatility. Markets will be calm and the Federal Reserve lives to see another day.

One ^more thing^:

There is a potential for a market crash during quad witching hour, regardless of the outcome of FOMC. Wall Street might doing a massive rotation from growth to value. This could plummet the value of growth stocks very quickly, setting off stop losses. If this happens, people could panic sell and it could snowball, bringing down the entire market with it. I don't believe there is a big chance of that, but there is a chance. I think it'll stabilize after a few trading days, but I thought I'd throw that out there.

If I'm wrong or misinformed about anything in the post, please comment below. Or if you have some tips on some plays regarding one of the 4 scenarios, let me know. *Let's make these tendies.*

**EDIT (because y’all keep messaging me and commenting about one of them going down or wanting to yolo into one) -**

**My positions for this week: **

$135 3/19 TLT Puts

$65 3/19 ITB Puts

$95 3/19 VNQ Calls

**TLT and ITB are betting that FOMC causes a spike in yields.**

**VNQ is my hedge if I’m wrong and yields fall.**

If yields spike, good, I make a lot of money. If yields fall, good, I still make enough to cover the expenses of the others expiring worthless, while still making profits. Stop messaging me laughing that one of the three are down, I know at least one will go down, that’s the whole fucking point of hedging.

*And no, those 3 positions aren’t my entire account. Even though I diversified, it’s only about a tenth of my portfolio. It’s very important to have the humility to admit to yourself that no matter how much time and effort you put into research, there’s still a possibility you could be wrong. There’s no such thing as a sure thing. If you think something is a for sure thing, it’s almost a for sure thing that you’re wrong. I’ve been burned too many times over the past years to risk a big portion of my portfolio on weeklys. I still manage my risks, no matter how big the potential reward is, and how little the potential risk may seem.*

Diversifying and hedging are still very important. I know y’all think diversifying is boomer shit, but when it comes to options it’s important. If you want to yolo into one, at least do long strangles. If your erection is pointing towards a certain direction, at least do a 2:1 ratio for strangles (having a ratio of 2 calls for every put for bullish, or having 2 puts for every call for bearish). Focus on preserving what you have. An almost certain 50% profit a week is way more lucrative over time than a low chance of 300%+ profit on a yolo. Understand greeks and what they mean. 

**Understand that stocks don’t move because of good news or bad news, they move because institutions want them to move aka low gamma (or not move if they sold strangles aka high gamma [keeps price action sideways rather than up or down]). They gamma hedge and delta hedge. They can literally rig the game by buying calls, selling puts, and then using billions to push the stock upwards, making profits off the puts they sold expiring worthless, making money off the calls they bought because they expire deep ITM, and profiting off the underlying stock they bought because of impulse waves and gamma squeezes from the people who sold them those calls.** 

**Don’t complain about how the game is rigged, think like an institution and figure out how to profit off of it. If you want to preach to your politicians to fix it and change laws and make it fair, you will be wasting your time and energy and will end up broke and depressed. Leave that to the social justice warriors. Look back over the past decade. Social media is flooded with them. All that time and energy and not a single thing has changed. I know because I’ve been there when it comes to complaining the game is rigged. It took years for it to finally click for me. And now I’m making money.**

Understand that and IV and set yourself up for success. If you use TDA’s ThinkOrSwim, you can use option screeners to find options that are near the money with phenomenal gamma and IV levels. Pair that with research on current events and macroeconomics to figure out which stock options are the correct puzzle piece for the puzzle you’re solving. 

Boomers diversify by buying stocks in all areas. Which is dumb. Because when one market goes up, another probably takes a hit. Those profits are very slow. This is very different. We’re intensely focused on two areas, which are yields and debt. This week has a massive impact on those two areas, primarily the yields. We expect big movement either upwards or downwards in yields, that’s why playing both sides works. Because even on the hedge, the movement that direction will be big enough to cover expenses and still come out with profit.

**YCC not implemented, but SLR is extended**

Yields might continue to rise, but not as fast as if YCC and SLR were both off the table. Probably could diversify with commodities and REIT. This one will be the least volatile and markets will probably continue to rise for a bit but slowly. This is the current state we’re in. Yields are still dramatically rising, but not as fast as they would with SLR being shot down. I’d play blue chips and value stocks IMO as well. If yields continue to rise, I’d begin shorting QQQ with puts, because once the 10 year hits 2.00%, there will be at least a 20% correction on the Nasdaq. I’d start buying puts around the 1.85% yield mark.

**YCC not implemented, and SLR is not extended**

Hold on to your seat belts. Yields are going through the absolute roof. Buy puts on TLT and make a fortune. Out of all the profit calculations on options I’ve ever done in history, this one is by far the most lucrative in terms of potential. Yields rise as bonds sell off. The lack of YCC and SLR will cause a massive sell of on bonds and potentially cause a gamma squeeze downwards. I’m talking 10k worth of puts being worth tens of millions in a months time.

**YCC implemented, and SLR not extended**

Massive increase in inflation, yields will probably go down. Commodities play. Don’t buy precious metals, because they’re not based off anything anymore. And they’re heavily manipulated. Buy ITB puts (home construction) and calls on commodity ETFs. Lumber will continue to skyrocket to the point that home builders will have to charge insane prices due to supply cost, leading to dramatically less demand. It’s currently forming a head and shoulders on the 1 month chart. Also the moratorium ends March 31st as well, leading to foreclosures. This will increase the supply of available homes on the market, thus, even less demand for home builders.

I personally believe the market wide crash will not happen until the economy is fully up and running, leading to a severe overheating of the economy. This is will cause the federal reserve to finally increase their rates once the CPI is finally hit hard. This is the catalyst for popping the mother of all bubbles. Might happen at the June FOMC, but more than likely it’ll be at the July, September, or November one. I think the highest probability is the September FOMC. Although, congress has to decide on the debt ceiling situation by July, and if the raising is rejected, that’ll cause the pop. Build up that capital by playing the policies to your advantage until then. Once you’ve built up enormous capital, you can buy puts on the SPY and ride around in your private jet safely while the country is up in flames.

In short, **do not place your bets in terms of the market**. Place your bets on the **feds policies** and **how those policies affect the overall markets**, and more importantly, the **subcategories** of the markets. Watch the ventriloquist (Fed), not the puppet (markets). Individual stocks are subject to manipulation, but ETFs are harder, as it’s harder and riskier to manipulate all the stocks in the industry. Which is why I do options on ETFs, rather than individual stocks. Just watch out for dividend risk. Many platforms don’t inform you that you have to pay dividends of those contracts to the contract seller, and those costs aren’t included in the contract costs. A 3% dividend might not seem like a lot, but remember, each contract is equivalent to 100 shares.

Hopefully this helps y’all. There’s money to be made in every market. When one market goes down, another one rises. If you can’t find it, keep looking. If there’s an off chance of literally no bull market (highly unlikely), flip the chart upside down and your calls now become puts.

AMC/GME will probably be profitable this week, but there WILL be a rug pull. Smart money vs dumb money ultimately comes down to the risk/reward ratio. Dumb money focuses more on the reward side, while smart money is focuses on the risk side. Set stop losses and realistic price targets (realistic for GameStop, as I believe it can multiply in price multiple times this week. Clearly, thinking Apple will multiply in price this week would be very unrealistic). Hedge funds are buying in as well. They see dumb money flooding the system and can profit off of it. Watch the volume in real time. Short and rapid volume rises means retail investors, large instantaneous leaps means institutions are buying. When they sell, the price squeezes downwards, as stop losses get triggered.

**TLDR;**

YCC implemented, SLR extended: calls on REIT ETFs (VNQ)

YCC implemented, SLR not extended: ITB puts (home construction etf), calls on commodities (CPER, PDBC, GSG)

YCC not implemented, SLR extended: stonks go sideways, diversify with calls on REIT and commodities (not precious metals) (lumber/sugar/coffee/copper)

YCC not implemented, SLR not extended: yields moon/potential market crash. Buy puts on TLT (20 year bond prices crater and fast)

If you want to make big money fast, print/make a cheat sheet of those 4 TLDR plays while watching the FOMC live. Set up your trade drafts in different tabs so all you have to do is click a button and beat the herd. If they announce one of the policies first, you can close out half of the plays, leaving only two tabs. I suspect we’ll do YCC not implemented and SLR extended, as it’ll slow the rise in yields, and also not cause massive volatility. Markets will be calm and the Federal Reserve lives to see another day.

One ^more thing^:

There is a potential for a market crash during quad witching hour, regardless of the outcome of FOMC. Wall Street might doing a massive rotation from growth to value. This could plummet the value of growth stocks very quickly, setting off stop losses. If this happens, people could panic sell and it could snowball, bringing down the entire market with it. I don't believe there is a big chance of that, but there is a chance. I think it'll stabilize after a few trading days, but I thought I'd throw that out there.

If I'm wrong or misinformed about anything in the post, please comment below. Or if you have some tips on some plays regarding one of the 4 scenarios, let me know. *Let's make these tendies.*

**EDIT (because y’all keep messaging me and commenting about one of them going down or wanting to yolo into one) -**

**My positions for this week: **

$135 3/19 TLT Puts

$65 3/19 ITB Puts

$95 3/19 VNQ Calls

**TLT and ITB are betting that FOMC causes a spike in yields.**

**VNQ is my hedge if I’m wrong and yields fall.**

If yields spike, good, I make a lot of money. If yields fall, good, I still make enough to cover the expenses of the others expiring worthless, while still making profits. Stop messaging me laughing that one of the three are down, I know at least one will go down, that’s the whole fucking point of hedging.

*And no, those 3 positions aren’t my entire account. Even though I diversified, it’s only about a tenth of my portfolio. It’s very important to have the humility to admit to yourself that no matter how much time and effort you put into research, there’s still a possibility you could be wrong. There’s no such thing as a sure thing. If you think something is a for sure thing, it’s almost a for sure thing that you’re wrong. I’ve been burned too many times over the past years to risk a big portion of my portfolio on weeklys. I still manage my risks, no matter how big the potential reward is, and how little the potential risk may seem.*

Diversifying and hedging are still very important. I know y’all think diversifying is boomer shit, but when it comes to options it’s important. If you want to yolo into one, at least do long strangles. If your erection is pointing towards a certain direction, at least do a 2:1 ratio for strangles (having a ratio of 2 calls for every put for bullish, or having 2 puts for every call for bearish). Focus on preserving what you have. An almost certain 50% profit a week is way more lucrative over time than a low chance of 300%+ profit on a yolo. Understand greeks and what they mean. 

**Understand that stocks don’t move because of good news or bad news, they move because institutions want them to move aka low gamma (or not move if they sold strangles aka high gamma [keeps price action sideways rather than up or down]). They gamma hedge and delta hedge. They can literally rig the game by buying calls, selling puts, and then using billions to push the stock upwards, making profits off the puts they sold expiring worthless, making money off the calls they bought because they expire deep ITM, and profiting off the underlying stock they bought because of impulse waves and gamma squeezes from the people who sold them those calls.** 

**Don’t complain about how the game is rigged, think like an institution and figure out how to profit off of it. If you want to preach to your politicians to fix it and change laws and make it fair, you will be wasting your time and energy and will end up broke and depressed. Leave that to the social justice warriors. Look back over the past decade. Social media is flooded with them. All that time and energy and not a single thing has changed. I know because I’ve been there when it comes to complaining the game is rigged. It took years for it to finally click for me. And now I’m making money.**

Understand that and IV and set yourself up for success. If you use TDA’s ThinkOrSwim, you can use option screeners to find options that are near the money with phenomenal gamma and IV levels. Pair that with research on current events and macroeconomics to figure out which stock options are the correct puzzle piece for the puzzle you’re solving. 

Boomers diversify by buying stocks in all areas. Which is dumb. Because when one market goes up, another probably takes a hit. Those profits are very slow. This is very different. We’re intensely focused on two areas, which are yields and debt. This week has a massive impact on those two areas, primarily the yields. We expect big movement either upwards or downwards in yields, that’s why playing both sides works. Because even on the hedge, the movement that direction will be big enough to cover expenses and still come out with profit.

I’ve been on WSB for years. This account has only been posting here for about a year and a half, but I had another Reddit i deleted when I was in the market for a new job. I know some of the OGs here will roast you for not taking the route of high risk high reward. It’s the culture that’s been here, and will always be here. Loss porn is funny, and gain porn makes you aroused. But both of those types of posts have a very important meaning behind it, and that’s to keep your feet on the ground, but your eyes to the stars. 

Per the words of Billy Joel on Vienna, 

“Dream big, but don’t imagine they all come true. When will you realize, Vienna waits for you.” 

That song has made huge impacts on almost every aspect of my life, especially investing.

For every person I see on here who have changed their entire life with the gains they’ve made, I’ve watched the same amount of people lose more than they could afford. I’ve watched newbies get burned bad and promise to themselves that they’ll never touch stocks again, and they don’t. I’ve watched newbies get burned so bad and become depressed, and their posts signal a call for help. I lost four close friends to suicide my final year of college in 2018. I don’t want that to happen to any of you. I want you to shrink the ranges of the highs and lows. Just like taking too much of a certain substance, those high highs feel very good, but when the very low lows come around, you realize the highs weren’t worth the lows in the end. And more importantly, I want you to be able to continue investing throughout your life. Though, the dynamics and culture has changed quite a bit since 9m people joined, I welcome all of you to the group. Even if I miss what this subreddit used to be, I’m excited and optimistic about the future of WSB. If you’re eager to help this subreddit in any way possible, educate yourself on the market, the past/present/future global events and news, and do your own research that expands beyond the horizon of GME and AMC. Keep the shilling to a minimum, and back up all your posts with evidence. We’ve all been in group projects before. We know that it sucks when only one person does all the work, while the others run around like idiots. Strive to make this subreddit an effective group project, where everybody helps pull their own weight. And also, keep posting those dank memes and drinking your own piss. Group projects are worth it when the group gets fucked up together after the work is all finished.

Good luck on your journeys, my messages are always open for advice. Don’t come in asking where you should throw your money into, I won’t respond. But if you ask questions on what to study, and my thoughts on certain trade ideas, or if you need someone to talk to, I’ll respond. 

UPDATE: ITB puts are printing due to the NAHB confirming that home builders took a hit from yields rising (increasing mortgage rates) as well lumber inflation, which was my prediction

And last but not least, the obligatory:

*Sir this is a Wendy's.*",Simplified FOMC Playbook for Smooth Brains,m568xl,213,334,0.93,334,0,,DD,False,True,1
1615761604.0,TLT,"**How to play FOMC this week**

Haven’t really been keeping up with WSB lately due to all the meme hype, so hopefully this isn’t repetitive of anything people have said lately. As you know, FOMC is coming up this week on the 16th and 17th. The Federal Reserve will post the changes on the ~~16th~~ 17th (Wednesday-shout out datguypete for catching that) at 2 PM EST. I did a quick browse on WSB to make sure this post wasn’t repetitive, and saw a few things explaining FOMC/YCC/SLR and potentially devastating effects, but I did not find anything regarding how to profit each of the 4 scenarios. Most seemed like doomsday posts, but I'm here to tell you, no matter the outcome of the FOMC, you can profit obesely. Not fat profits. *Obese profits.*

**I’ve explained below the 4 different scenarios and outcomes of the FOMC and what to play in regards to those outcomes. If you don’t want to read this, I’ll put a TLDR cheat sheet at the bottom.**

My final paragraph includes GME and AMC for those of you who bear so much sexual aggression to those stocks that society should not allow you to be out in public due to the *safety of others.*

If you haven’t kept up with everything regarding treasuries and the SLR policy, I’ll try and fill you in without you having to know the finance technicals and what not. This is not a doomsday post so don’t throw a tantrum when I mention bubbles which beginsssss *now* -&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Right now we currently are in every bubble possible, but certain ones are more important to keep going instead of other ones (to save face). J Pow has been kicking the can further and further to hold off the inevitable, ultimately making things worse each time he does it. There’s a few different types of bubbles: market (housing in this case), commodity, stock market, credit bubble, economy bubble. Asset inflation is very profitable for the wealthy, and for those who know how to use it to their advantage, which is why Wall Street wants the economy and stock market to overheat. On the other hand, asset inflation destroys those who cannot afford assets, as they won't be able to buy a home, a car, or invest, because that inflation seeps into necessities, leaving them no money to invest and get ahead. Which is why the wealth gap rapidly expanded during covid to levels unseen since the lead up to the 1929 crash.

**Types of Bubbles:**

**Commodities** 

Moon during inflation (lumber, oil, coffee, copper, sugar, etc). Most likely won’t see this crash until later on. Because this is the final stage of inflation before prices begin to inflate groceries which is a big influence on CPI. Things like sugar and coffee beans increase the price of groceries that include those ingredients. 
The Federal Reserve goes off the CPI when reporting inflation, and even changes the rules when they publish them, to keep CPI down. We’ve been locked up, so the massive money injections are found in assets, such as the housing market, commodities, and the stock market. All this asset inflation will eventually spill over to CPI, and when that happens, the Fed will increase their rates, popping everything. The trickle begins to grow into a pour the more the economy opens up.

**Housing bubble**

Residential real estate in this case, although commercial are on the rise (they took a massive hit when covid hit unlike residential because WFH/Stimmys/Low mortgage rates, while offices and commercial buildings closed down).  Commercial real estate isn’t a bubble yet, but since prices were historically low, and real estate inflation is building fast, i believe these will rise the fastest (VNQ is very lucrative, it also just closed above major resistance Friday). Most likely won’t let this crash until end of summer or during the fall.

**Stock market** 

Very clear and everybody knows it, but it’s not about if, it’s about when. Unlikely they’ll let it fail right now. Most likely won’t crash until end of summer or during the fall. A crash of the stock market would mean people panicking about their life savings, and saving their money, rather than spend it in the reopening of the economy.

**Credit Bubble** 

QE, low fed rates, stimulus, credit forbearance, student loan forbearance, rent forbearance, etc all built the credit bubble. Probably won’t let this fall because it’ll be mayhem, and will lead to the pop of all the other bubbles. Although, the rent moratorium ending March 31st might exacerbate the credit bubble, paired with no more stimulus forecasted in the future.

**Economic bubble**

Related to the concept of market bubbles is the idea of a general economic boom. A boom implies that the economy expands at an unsustainably fast rate, leading to inflation (e.g. aggregate demand grows faster than productive capacity). Ultimately an economic boom usually proves unsustainable. There may be a strong link between market bubbles and an economic boom. For example, a house price bubble may cause rising wealth and confidence leading to higher consumer spending and economic growth. In turn, the higher economic growth feeds the housing boom. Clearly they won’t let this pop right now because we’re finally reopening. Even though reopening will exacerbate it immensely.


So as you can see, we’re in quite a pickle. A lot comes down to FOMC.


**Things to watch at FOMC:**

**Yield Curve Control**

Increases our debt tremendously adding to inflation. Lowers yields on treasuries that have been mooning lately, as they vastly increase the amount of bonds they buy to decrease the yield. We’re already doing this somewhat, as the Fed spends $120b a month on bonds.

**Supplementary Leverage Ratio** 

When covid first caused havoc, the Federal Reserve eased the leverage rules for large banks by exempting certain investments from their leverage calculations. If that sentence sounds like pig Latin to you don’t worry it doesn’t matter if you understand it, what matters is how to make money off the policy extension/ending. The banks were able to exempt any holdings in U.S. Treasury debt or deposits at the Fed from their calculations of the supplementary leverage ratio. It was supposed to end March 31st. Everybody thought that was the plan. J Pow even said a few months back they have no plans of extending it. But then the yields began to rise and fast. 

Recently, J Pow shocked the public by hinting they might extend the SLR, or potentially make it permanent. They can’t afford to do YCC (they might anyways because they have a trend of positive short term outlook at the cost of long term growth), so if they get rid of SLR without YCC, more than likely every bubble pops. Not extending SLR means that every bank potentially sells off over a trillion dollars in treasuries, skyrocketing the yields, causing a huge tech sell off, and more than likely bringing the entire market with it, popping the stock market bubble. Mortgage rates move with the 10 year treasury, so mortgage rates skyrocket, popping the housing bubble. A popped housing bubble, will pop the credit bubble. And so on. Eventually sending us into a catastrophe worse than the covid recession (if you want to call that a recession), and potentially worse than the Great Depression. Higher yields means that the debt the Federal Reserve has put themselves in, becomes more costly, and the Federal Reserve and the United States government will become bankrupt and default on the debts we owe to foreign countries. However, lots of people on Capitol Hill are begging the Federal Reserve to not extend it, because SLR is one of the most important regulations for Wall Street to not take advantage of the average Joe, and was implemented after the 2008 crisis. The relaxed SLR covid policy is the reason why the wealth gap grew to levels unseen since 1929 (right before the Great Depression) during Covid.

Rather than fearing inflation and moving to cash (which is dumb as hell if there’s inflation on the rise, because your money becomes less valuable by the minute), use it to your advantage.

**4 scenarios and how to play them:**

**YCC implemented, and SLR is extended**

Play REIT ETFs (i have calls on VNQ expiring Friday that i bought at close last Friday). I might sell before the FOMC. The combo of both of these means inflation dramatically goes up, while yields will become incredibly suppressed, keeping real estate prices inflating, and mortgage rates low. Can also begin playing speculative technology again. I’d be cautious tho. Because there’s a chance people start selling bonds faster than YCC and SLR can support it. Collapsing the whole bond system, wiping 80%+ off of Nasdaq. J.P. Morgan predicted a minimum crash of 20% if the 10 year treasury yield hits 2.00%.

**YCC not implemented, but SLR is extended**

Yields might continue to rise, but not as fast as if YCC and SLR were both off the table. Probably could diversify with commodities and REIT.

Hold on to your seat belts. Yields are going through the absolute roof. Buy puts on TLT and make a fortune. Out of all the profit calculations on options I’ve ever done in history, this one is by far the most lucrative in terms of potential. Yields rise as bonds sell off. The lack of YCC and SLR will cause a massive sell of on bonds and potentially cause a gamma squeeze downwards. I’m talking 10k worth of puts being worth tens of millions in a months time.

**YCC implemented, and SLR not extended**

Massive increase in inflation, yields will probably go down. Commodities play. Don’t buy precious metals, because they’re not based off anything anymore. And they’re heavily manipulated. Buy ITB puts (home construction) and calls on commodity ETFs. Lumber will continue to skyrocket to the point that home builders will have to charge insane prices due to supply cost, leading to dramatically less demand. It’s currently forming a head and shoulders on the 1 month chart. Also the moratorium ends March 31st as well, leading to foreclosures.

I don’t want that to happen to any of you. I want you to shrink the ranges of the highs and lows. Just like taking too much of a certain substance, those high highs feel very good, but when the very low lows come around, you realize the highs weren’t worth the lows in the end. And more importantly, I want you to be able to continue investing throughout your life. Though, the dynamics and culture has changed quite a bit since 9m people joined, I welcome all of you to the group. Even if I miss what this subreddit used to be, I’m excited and optimistic about the future of WSB. If you’re eager to help this subreddit in any way possible, educate yourself on the market, the past/present/future global events and news, and do your own research that expands beyond the horizon of GME and AMC. Keep the shilling to a minimum, and back up all your posts with evidence. We’ve all been in group projects before. We know that it sucks when only one person does all the work, while the others run around like idiots. Strive to make this subreddit an effective group project, where everybody helps pull their own weight. And also, keep posting those dank memes and drinking your own piss. Group projects are worth it when the group gets fucked up together after the work is all finished.

Good luck on your journeys, my messages are always open for advice. Don’t come in asking where you should throw your money into, I won’t respond. But if you ask questions on what to study, and my thoughts on certain trade ideas, or if you need someone to talk to, I’ll respond. 

UPDATE: ITB puts are printing due to the NAHB confirming that home builders took a hit from yields rising (increasing mortgage rates) as well lumber inflation, which was my prediction

1615756512.0,WEN,"Yeah, you heard it right, and you most likely know that already, but lemme give you some technical rationale of how this might happen. The analysis is build upon fractal techniques, so that the previous price action is used for making this forecast. Buckle up and eat a Crayon, fellow trader (the word is used as anagram you know for what) as it will help you stay nutrated for the rest of this reading, and it might even help you with the digestion (of the information in the post).

This is not a financial advice and I am not and a professional advisor, I just enjoy to share my knowledge and educate brainless apes occasionally.

""BuT whY dO I neEd your FARTCAL ANALizis?!1""

Well, that's a good question. When I was a young ape living free in the Steppes of Kazakhstan... JK, leave poor Vlad alone for a moment. **The fractal** (from Latin *fractus*) means a steady scalable design of irregular shape emerging on any data. The trade fractal in the financial market is the pattern, formed by a sequence(es) of candles, which has peculiar identifiable characteristics and a tendency to reoccur across different scales and time-frames. Fractals are simple yet important, repetitive formations used by traders to identify and to confirm a trend. Apely speaking, fartcals allow us to forecast the future price action based on the previous similar trends on a given trading instrument.

Now that the captain is gone, let's get to business.

[GME fartcals wroom wroom](https://preview.redd.it/yge17n3k12n61.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=d533ec1fdbcf6443b2233142f87bb285f0c27786)

I know that you all love Crayons with all of your hearts, so I will use rare turquoise and magenta ones in this analysis. Furthermore, I did my best to simplify the method of distinguishing the fractal sequences, using simple lines, and hopefully you should need no more than one brain wrinkle to understand it.  
What you see on the chart (one candle represents 2 hours of price action) above is a perfect example of beautiful fractals. The chart starts from the 11th of January with the turquoise slightly downward tilted consolidation. Next you see a relatively soft magenta upward impulse (14-16 Jan), followed by another turquoise consolidation, this time slightly tilting up and lasting for about three days. Next is where the things really start to get interesting (22nd Jan), as the subsequent magenta upward impulse accelerates exponentially. This accelerection does not go quietly, erupting into a powerful gap (not as big as the one in your head, though). Finally, starting 27th of Jan we have a local endgame highlighted by a purple rectangle with the apex (pay attention to this peak, as it will be used for calculations later) on the 27th of January. 'What? Why purple rectangle?' you may ask. Easy. REKTangles are the Horsemen of the Endgame.  
That was only the left part of the chart. Now let's be brief for a moment. There were six main components to the fractal base: turquoise consolidation, magenta uptrend, turquoise consolidation 2, magenta impulse, gap and purple rectangle. What you see on the right, is the original base for the fractal described above meets its bigger brother. Particularly, starting 22nd Feb a very similar chain of price actions manifests. And this is how we really utilize fractals: identify the fractal sequence from the previous data (on the left), and after that apply the pattern to similar market conditions (on the right). Many of the the things look really similar on both sides of the graph, don't they? Coincidence? I think not.

Allrighty. I know that the energy from the Crayon you ate is running out, so lemme summarize the analysis for this intellectually limited individual with extraordinary small brain capacity that you are. What I need you to do now is what even a half brained chimpanzee is capable of. Count to six (yes, you may use your fingers). Twice.

[Numbers and fractals simplified for dummies](https://preview.redd.it/mfnkdif022n61.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d2fd1b92e9a7bf6c2bbeb0fac0ed538ea35d96b)

3 = line as flat as your wife's girlfriend's tit;  
4 = accelerection;  
5 = your brain (aka Gap);  
6 = Valhala REKTangle / GME go BBBBRRRRRRR  


Good boy/girl, you've come this far. Now that your confirmation bias is reinforced, you may get some rest. Or eat another nutritious crayon my brain destitute ape friend, because we are DIVING DEEPER.

Ok, it turned out that I needed to eat some Crayons myself, because I really got exhausted writing the post for five hours in a row. So I ate a pack this time, and I am full of GMEnergy. As is the chart below, so bullish, that we will definitely see some GMEnergy explosions in a short time to come. Now the complexity of analysis is going to increase a little bit, but the apes have to evolve at one point in history, so I really encourage you to use this opportunity.   


[In-depth fractal forecast](https://preview.redd.it/888zsh3c22n61.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec2c553761a27dc98efa7dae3de918da0d4f600f)

I hope that you got accustomed to the previous six steps for dummies explanation, and by this moment you should understand the basic principle of how the fractals play. What you see above is a little bit more advanced chart, through which I aim to explain how I came to the price predictions in the post title (finally!). Ok, 1 2 3 4 5 6 is understandable, where did A B come from? The first and most important notice, is that A-B fractals are built upon 1-2-3-4-5-6, and on the chart you can see that A measures 1-2-3-4 pattern, while B covers 5-6 steps of the sequence. A-B on the left (January run) is self explanatory, the fractals are measured as they are. A-B on the right (current price action formation) is where we need some math to get involved, particularly, when we are working with the new B movement prediction. And that is not as difficult as it may seem from a first glance. Again, the main fractal property, re-occurrence, will play on our side. Predicting the price movements, on a volatile market like this one, is one of the most ungrateful things to do, so don't go too harsh on what I am going share with you, apesters. My theory, is that it is possible to predict the amplitude of the upcoming move, using data from previous one. And here, we only need the coefficient from first A-B move. A simple ratio: dividing first B move (about $325 increase) by first A move ($131) gives us a coefficient of about 2,48. Let's apply this ratio to the currently forming fractal: that is multiplying the second A fractal completed height (about $330 based on my prediction, which is built later in this post), which will give the estimated B part of the second fractal height of about $818, landing us on the sweet $1200 dollar level through the next week. Boom, looks beautiful and promising! Fractals, baby!  


I hope it has been an entertaining as well as mentally developing read for you so far, smoothie-brainie. But there is still one important part of the analysis left to be addressed. Particularly, it is the the sequence part number 4, where the price action stands currently. And yeah, you guessed it, almighty fractals are helping us here again. Below you will find two charts (both are 30 min charts), which are actually zoomed in the price actions of the fourth step of the two fractals analyzed above. I can't stop enjoying and appreciating fractals and below you should really see why.  


[GME price action 22-27 January](https://preview.redd.it/heozo1gg22n61.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=d637c1806d229ffad089dc6491357ce01b55207a)

Because they look similar again! Now I will ask you to excuse me, I started to work on this analysis about ten hours ago, and I really need to get some sleep, as my brain is holding strong to the last wrinkle it has left, so this explanation will be brief. I forecasted the apex point of the current 4 using not so complicated method, and again taking inspiration from the previous price action and its underlying patterns. The magenta curly lines play as supports for both of the impulses. And these look amazingly similar in its slope and pace, but we should probably stop being surprised about that at this point. The second important fractal factor is this chainsaw in the middle of the patterns, corresponding to the severe corrections in these bull runs. Remember being in the market at those moments? Wooh, that was fun. And finally, take a look at this averaged line that looks like a string of a bow - not only it averages the price action, it also completes this bow shaped fractal pattern, allowing us to predict the potential high of the current price action ($380-ish). That's it folks, mic drop.

1615752437.0,CLOV,"Hindenburg Research – and if you don’t hate them yet, you will soon when they attack one of your holdings.

**Who is Hindenburg Research?**

“Hindenburg Research” is a tiny[ 5-man shop](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-nikola-stock-got-torched-by-a-short-seller-11600867055) based out of an[ apartment in New York](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ny/5471661). They are primarily known for their hit-piece on Nikola last year - which further exposed the company for misleading investors and caused the stock to continue crashing down.

They take large short positions in companies, put out extensive and detailed hit-pieces against them, induce panic (causing people to sell), and then they just take their profits and move on to their next target. They don’t care if they are right or wrong on their “research” because they will profit on their short position regardless.

Their ideal targets are early-stage growth company stocks that have a low float – these types of stocks are more volatile (thus, allowing them to make exponentially higher profits from their short positions after releasing their “reports”).

Here are examples of other stocks they have attacked: $CLOV, $SOS, $MVIS, $JCOM – to name a few.

&#x200B;

**Where do they get their research?**

This is the million-dollar question.

They rarely cite their sources, yet they produce very detailed reports. These reports historically contain many inaccuracies while damaging the reputation of legitimate companies and hurting retail investors like us.

In their most recent attack against [GM-backed Lordstown Motors](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) on Friday, the basis of over half of their report is based on “conversations they had” with undisclosed “former employees” of the company.

Former employees??? That is their source??? These are probably ex-employees that got fired.

That is the equivalent of someone asking my ex-girlfriend what she thinks of me.. Don’t imagine she’s going to have too many nice things to say.

&#x200B;

**Here is why what they did to Lordstown Motors is wrong:**

Let’s be clear. This is no Nikola.

Hindenburg neglected to contact Lordstown Motors for a tour of their [6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html) and refused to take a test drive of their Alpha Endurance vehicle.

Hindenburg also RUSHED the publishing of their report during a “quiet-period” right before earnings this Wednesday because CEO Steve Burns mentioned in a [video last week](https://video.foxnews.com/v/6237427669001#sp=show-clips) that production is on track for September, and, starting on March 17th, LM would begin reporting actual orders instead of pre-orders.

Lordstown Motors has already said they are preparing to release a [“thorough” statement](https://www.mahoningmatters.com/local-news/is-lordstown-motors-a-mirage-a-stock-market-research-firm-just-published-a-deep-dive-into-the-voltage-valley-leader-3539242) and will “absolutely” be refuting the Hindenburg Research report.

&#x200B;

**In summary:**

I will include a link to my full DD post / Hindenburg rebuttal in the comments below as well if you want to read a more in-depth analysis into Lordstown Motors and their business model. They are initially targeting fleet/government/business contracts with their truck. *Disclosure:* I am long $RIDE and felt like these allegations from Hindenburg Research were unfair to Lordstown Motors and investors alike.

In addition, I’ll let you be the judge – should Hindenburg be allowed to continuously get away with these attacks?

What I love most about this WSB community is that we can come on here and speak freely when we feel like us apes have been wronged.

I wanted to raise awareness into what Hindenburg Research has been getting away with and hopefully *prevent it from happening to you in the future*.

&#x200B;

**I’ll leave you with this question: Who has more credibility in the following scenario?**

A 5-man “research firm” ran out of an apartment in New York **or** a company with 500+ employees, the 3rd largest automotive plant in the country, and the backing of two different multi-billion dollar corporations via investments and partnerships.. The answer here is pretty obvious.

Almost 20 million $RIDE shares were shorted on Friday as a part of this attack. I think this weekend is a great time to rally the troops and make sure those that didn’t close out their short positions get burned this week – and it begins tomorrow.

**TLDR;**

Hindenburg Research attacked a company based out of a small town in Ohio that is producing electric pick-up trucks for the hard-working men and women of this country. The American dream is all about building a company from the ground-up that will make the world a better place – for Lordstown Motors, that means bringing the first **full-size** electric pick-up to market this September. The goal of this post is to raise awareness into what Hindenburg Research has been getting away with and refute their allegations into Lordstown Motors.

**Who is Hindenburg Research?**

“Hindenburg Research” is a tiny[ 5-man shop](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-nikola-stock-got-torched-by-a-short-seller-11600867055) based out of an[ apartment in New York](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ny/5471661). They are primarily known for their hit-piece on Nikola last year - which further exposed the company for misleading investors and caused the stock to continue crashing down.

They take large short positions in companies, put out extensive and detailed hit-pieces against them, induce panic (causing people to sell), and then they just take their profits and move on to their next target. They don’t care if they are right or wrong on their “research” because they will profit on their short position regardless.

Their ideal targets are early-stage growth company stocks that have a low float – these types of stocks are more volatile (thus, allowing them to make exponentially higher profits from their short positions after releasing their “reports”).

Here are examples of other stocks they have attacked: $CLOV, $SOS, $MVIS, $JCOM – to name a few.

&#x200B;

**Where do they get their research?**

This is the million-dollar question.

They rarely cite their sources, yet they produce very detailed reports. These reports historically contain many inaccuracies while damaging the reputation of legitimate companies and hurting retail investors like us.

In their most recent attack against [GM-backed Lordstown Motors](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) on Friday, the basis of over half of their report is based on “conversations they had” with undisclosed “former employees” of the company.

Former employees??? That is their source??? These are probably ex-employees that got fired.

That is the equivalent of someone asking my ex-girlfriend what she thinks of me.. Don’t imagine she’s going to have too many nice things to say.

The points remain the same even with a few percent differential. This is strictly to get a realistic view of retail power. There is lots of data out there, some of it contradicts or is different from one another, I'm just trying to give you some data. I'm sick of the ""retail is nothing"" push, and I'm here to prove it wrong.

USER NUMBERS FOR BROKERAGES

* Robinhood 13m users, - **7.5m owned GME** during a period in Jan. We know around 50% of users held GME on robinhood in Jan.
   * Average account size - [$3500](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/robinhood-statistics/) (Other estimates are $1000-$5000 from J M (<- for automod) Pee, and $4800 from Alphacution) Total would then be $45.5B. Used this line of data for anything I did later.. but..
      * "" J M Pee Securities analyst Devin Ryan estimates Robinhood’s total accounts are now closer to 23 million"" [Here](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/robinhood-is-still-on-track-for-a-hot-ipo-despite-the-gamestop-controversy-.html#:~:text=Robinhood's%20Tenev%20told%20Congress%20last,about%20%245%2C000%2C%20the%20company%20said)
      * ""Its average account size is about $5,000, the company \[Robinhood\] said"" \^ same link as above
* E-trade- 5.2m users
   * Assets under management (retail) $346 billion
   * $66,538 average acc size for retail
* TD ameritrade- 11m users
   * Average account size [118k](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/online-brokerage-statistics/)
   * $1.3 TRILLION total
* Interactive brokers 1.25m users
   * Average account size 264k [(this is a PDF by the way)](https://investors.interactivebrokers.com/ir/main.php?file=latestMetricPR)
   * $330B total
* Allyinvest - 350k users
   * Average account size [22k](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/online-brokerage-statistics/)
   * $7.7B total
* WeBull (at least) 2m users
   * Rough estimate average account size [$3k](https://www.brokerage-review.com/investing-firm/assets-under-management/webull-aum.aspx#:)
   * Rough estimate total $30B
* Schwab (as of June 2020) 14.1m
   * Average acc size [327k](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/online-brokerage-statistics/)
   * $4T total
* Fidelity 30m users, harder to find exact numbers on Fidelity
   * ""Approximately [$3.6 trillion](https://www.brokerage-review.com/investing-firm/assets-under-management/fidelity-aum.aspx) of broker’s client assets are in non-managed accounts and funds.""
      * 120k average non-managed (based on above figures)
   * ""About $1.3 trillion are managed by Fidelity investment advisors"" \^same article
      * 43.3k average managed (based on above figures)
* Tradestation 1m users <--- this one may be very very inaccurate, struggling to find good info
* Merrill Edge (as of sept 2018) 2.5m <----- Also been hard to find great info on them, not thrilled with my source
   * (As of June 2020) ""responsible for more than [$962 billion](https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/investing/merrill-lynch-wealth-management-review-ria/#MerrillLynchWealthManagementshighlights) assets under management""
   * That would mean average user $24.8k
* Vanguard 30m+ users
   * Read [this PDF](https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/how-america-invests-2020.pdf), a LOTS of good info in here. Read below first, 2nd bullet is important to understand.
      * ""Recognizing that the household is the primary economic unit, the focus of this analysis is at the household level. The universe for our analysis consists of 5.1 million Vanguard retail investor households. The median household size is one person. Collectively, **households in this report are investing close to $2 trillion** in their accounts at Vanguard, with a median account balance of **$60,900.**""
      * ""**for this report, only those enrolled in Vanguard Personal Advisor Services® (PAS) are known to be advised**"" - I assume this is why they have 30m users, but only 5.1m in this report. Not everyone uses PAS, that's for getting access to advisors (and paying a fee).
      * Vangaurd reports [30m investors](https://about.vanguard.com/who-we-are/fast-facts/) and total of $6T AUM
* Firstrade 1m+ users
   * These are estimates, but [7k average account size](https://www.brokerage-review.com/investing-firm/assets-under-management/firstrade-aum.aspx) for a total of $70B AUM

97.9m\~ users WITHOUT including Robinhood. Just shy of $18 TRILLION rough numbers. Then remember, *there's international markets*. [This article](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/29/investing/china-gamestop-investors-intl-hnk/index.html) doesn't have sources, but it points out how global GME went. There's many more articles like it, for plenty of countries. Europe, India, Asia are several places I saw people trying to get in on the action. ""China’s approximately 200 million retail investors trade more often than any other investors on Earth—81 percent said they trade at least once a month"" [From this article](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/09/three-charts-explaining-chinas-strange-stock-market.html)

*Let me remind you that a stock like GME as of today has estimated between 27m-40m shares in the float, and a market cap of 18.4B at today's price.* **Retail has no control my ass**. Lets take a look at this:

A graph of apple users versus apple price from robinhood's API in 2020, going up to 8/6/2020. They stopped offering this information via API at this date.  We can ignore apple price here, we're looking just at ownership.

&#x200B;

[Source: Robintrack.net](https://preview.redd.it/1xji566rn1n61.png?width=1633&format=png&auto=webp&s=202fbbb95234ba5a1a6ae13453c992879805b25e)

The above shows on 8/6, 730k RH users owned Apple. That's 5.6% of users at the time using their 13m users number, which the total user number I would speculate is a bit lower at that time, as they grew from 10 to 13m users in 2020. RH stopped their API showing this info, so 8/6 is the most recent you can get on any company.

&#x200B;

GME was the most popular stock on RH, so I find it reasonable to believe at least 5% owned it, most likely WAY WAY more considering the global exposure this got. Once again, RH average account size is $5k. Please do the math here of how Jan may have looked. **This is ONLY on Robinhood**. Of course this is speculation here, but I feel that it's pretty reasonable. It's speculation based on prior data. & if users really are 23m, that's even crazier. Here's math below about what GME could have looked like. This is based on 13m users. Then, **add all of the other brokers**. This chart is only robinhood. You get the idea. Realistically, *other* brokers ownership percentage probably isn't *as* high, but it's still going to be way up there, especially during the GME phenomenon.

&#x200B;

|If average # of shares per person is|% of RH users that owned the most popular stock|Total shares owned on RH|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|5|730k shares|
|1|10|1.46m shares|
|5|5|3.65m shares|
|5|10|7.3m shares|

Anyways, moving back to the more broad discussion and no longer focusing on GME.

""The **total market capitalization** of the **U.S. stock market** is $50,808,508.7 million(over complicated way of saying $50.8T (12/31/2020)""

It appears our estimates line up pretty closely with other data. *Notice how mutual funds are SEPERATE here.*

So why does retail ""not control the market"" ?

Personally, I disagree with this statement. Retail does control the market. **Then why is there a narrative that retail doesn't control the market?** Two main reasons in my opinion. Yes, this is speculation based on data. Form your own conclusions. Here's insight into mine.

1. Retail isn't coordinated. Even though we collectively own over 1/3 of the market, we can't coordinate things like the elite can. We can't dump 1 million shares all at the exact same time to tank a stock price. We can't control the media narrative because we don't own/aren't in bed with the media, so we lose some influence here. Retail doesn't control the day to day action on a stock, but retail controls it from a broader sense. *One raindrop cannot cause a flood, but continuous raindrops over an extended period of time do*.
2. Information **IS** becoming a commodity, there's just so much shit and misinformation to sift through right now, it's difficult for most people. Retail gains more and more control every day through decentralization and increased freedom of information on the internet. *They ARE terrified of retail*. The potential for ""power"" to shift back to the people out of the elites hands is higher than ever with the advancements of tech. I could write a whole paper on this concept. I believe decentralization is the future for everything. Information, politics, money, stocks, etc. It is imperative for the elite to keep this knowledge away from the people. Knowledge is power. Poverty and education are linked significantly. Keeping people in the dark and unaware of their capabilities is an extremely powerful tool that has been used to suppress people since civilization began.

I know above points might sound a little bit over the top, but these are my opinions based on data. I'd be happy to engage in talks around any of these points. There may be data that is just plain wrong, or that I misinterpreted. Please poke holes in anything.

Edit: /u/alice_oe made this data point “I use the European broker eToro, they have 20 million users and their app currently shows that 9.49% of them holds GME. In January this number was around 15%.”

1615749578.0,CRWD,"Dear Member,   
Hello fellow degenerate gambler! May I introduce you to the Pretty Decent Crew's newsletter for the trading week ending on March 19th? 

First things first, I'm going to keep using the sorta-kinda-gold-but-on-a-computer and banned tickers as recommendations because they make money. If you don't like it, find a different newsletter and I'll keep napping on my piles of virtual cash sitting in my SPAC bed. This is my return from ban by WSB for it and most of those degenerates are better at making memes than they are at investing so I guess I kind of had it coming. Sooooo here we go again! 

We're going to pick up right where we left off with some serious consideration of the wants/needs of people who are leaving the pandemic lockdown with hopes and aspirations of having a good time again. We got Carnival Cruise lines for a smash hit a few weeks back and we're going to find more (full disclosure: I'm definitely going to play them again). Our other acknowledgement is that virtual cash is tearing right now. That isn't going to stop. Grab a ticket for the tendie train and ride it until the wheels fall off. If you're not in already, just get what you can. Imagine you're buying and holding a super special magic version of SPY shares.   
CRWD - 3/19 $220c  
My weekly pick is going to be CRWD. They've had a terrible week/month and are sitting $53 under their 52-week high. They've been wildly successful at beating earnings and continuing to improve their per/share outcomes. Here is the deal, everybody loves a good ramp up to earnings report, but the earning report itself could screw everything up. My take is this: the stimmy is getting delivered and they're going to beat earnings while trading at \~80% of ATH. Will it return to ATH? Doubtful. It will more than likely take a serious upturn and hopefully push for $220. I'm going to grab the $220c for 3/19 and hopefully dump within a day. Maybe before the earnings even deliver...   
CCL - 7/16 $40c  
I have to do it. The goal is open season for ALL adults in the US by May 1st. Give that 4 weeks and we're looking summer travel dead in the eyes. We all know your redneck cousins in Nebraska are excited to get back on a boat for fake vacations to the carribean. They've got Facebook posts to catch up on. I'm looking at the July 16th $40c for movement back to $10 under their pre-pandemic numbers ($30 under ATH). As always, do NOT hold these when you hit your profit goal %. Dump that   
NVDA - 5/21 $610c  
Here is the wild card for you. Nvidia is trading at $100 under ATH and their progress as a companies shows absolutely no signs of slowing down at all. Given the landscape, they've had a terrible month, but the company is not only solid, but they're increasing demand with the need for GPUs related to mining. The 5/21 date is paired along with the earnings report that will happen then. We all know they're going to produce an insane amount of profit and when that hits, we're going to cash in big time.   
SNDL - 3/19 $1.5p  
If you're a real degenerate gambler looking to get yourself high blood pressure, play this one with me. Sundial Growers delivers earnings after close on Wednesday. We all know the future legalization of marijuana is going to make them a huge company, but right now they're trash and we all know it. They're the penny stock of weed companies. They've had a GREAT week leading up to earnings. I'm going to wait until the end of the day Tuesday or Wednesday to watch it go up more. When it hits $1.50+, I'm going to grab some puts. Here is the delicate part: it doesn't move much at all in comparison to those option prices. So what we're going to do is grab $1.50 puts for 3/19 that are already almost ITM. Then hold those babies when they flop on earnings. Full disclosure: this is an absolutely STUPID play, but it's going to be hilarious if it works.   
Good luck this week! May the power of J-Pow be with you in Tendie Land.

# Purpose

The purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.

\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH?

\- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?

\- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

\- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?

\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# The Fundamental Constraint

**MOD DISCLAIMER: This post discusses B\*tcoin in an academic sense. I absolutely do not intend for this post to be speculative about the asset by any means and it is solely within the context of Square's strategy, business risk, and environment. This post is about under-banking, regulatory constraints, and financial services.**

&#x200B;

[The Underbanking Map](https://preview.redd.it/vpf82nkta1n61.png?width=1613&format=png&auto=webp&s=08837c21faf22549f3bfa8292a6fece047f9b4cd)

This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It’s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer.

&#x200B;

A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements.

&#x200B;

It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, **trustworthiness and accountability must be established**. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B\*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you’re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else.

&#x200B;

[The KYC Bottleneck](https://preview.redd.it/shluc14va1n61.png?width=2073&format=png&auto=webp&s=c594663c43f266c2bab1d0bf5b4547b3d1da2382)

Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[The KYC Solution](https://preview.redd.it/2oueufhxb1n61.png?width=1457&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b3d6e4bb85aa337ed3a0f581929b4d8c2e70eed)

It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B\*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z.

[Black American Enterprise](https://preview.redd.it/xbdw0cnxa1n61.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=32e45ab15c55d54201f82e349bb86594c74cb68c)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem.

# The Underbanked

Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted

&#x200B;

[The playbook](https://preview.redd.it/1eiwe2j1b1n61.png?width=1494&format=png&auto=webp&s=f81927188476f40d136d884d18be7a5cb172ef49)

Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards.

In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things:

\- Cash App’s Twitter and advertising strategy

&#x200B;

[Urban strategy](https://preview.redd.it/c4gc0lvfb1n61.png?width=1487&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2b69447ee9c822aef198c97fcb83d7c992b886b)

&#x200B;

[Youth strategy](https://preview.redd.it/dyhd7ssgb1n61.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd5780a188b29e1a930b5d85cdd0272e01844a65)

\- The geographic results on Google Trends when searching “Cash App vs. Venmo”. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty.

&#x200B;

[Underbanking strategy](https://preview.redd.it/xruw28aib1n61.png?width=2949&format=png&auto=webp&s=58c21fefe36277359c1d37adfa86b592d009af52)

&#x200B;

It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water.  That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square’s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You’ve heard it before, “why doesn’t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?”. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers:

1. The ability to start a business
2. The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks
3. The ability to invest and educate in B\*tcoin
4. The ability to save on basic purchases
5. The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to)

&#x200B;

[Reality](https://preview.redd.it/hb2b2zljb1n61.png?width=1402&format=png&auto=webp&s=5aa1cce454480fe56d30489feeae3a52809dc559)

What this inevitably means is that we probably won’t even see Square operating at “full-force” until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials.

# Speculation

This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks:

1. Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank’s regulatory offerings.
2. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services.
3. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process.
4. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard.
5. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify.
6. Square will foray into equal housing.
7. Square will improved loan systems.
8. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis.

1615740645.0,ANY,"I called $DIS 6 months ago when it was hovering around $125 and y'all didn't listen. Maybe you will this time.

I have to talk about $CPNG (Coupang aka ""Amazon of Korea"" aka ""Chef Pang"" aka ""C Piddy"") because y'all need to put some respect on its name. It's one of the largest tech companies to IPO on the NYSE ever ($55B) and the largest tech IPO in South Korean history. This isn't just some company. It's THE company. How often do you get a chance to invest in the next Amazon of?

Some of its notable backers are Softbank, Blackrock, Bill Ackman, Stanley Druckenmiller, and David Frankel.

Before trying to understand Coupang, you have to understand South Korea as a country.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

APE MUST READ

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

South Korea is a first-world country with the 11th largest economy (i.e., GDP) in the world. That makes them bigger than Russia, Spain, Australia, Mexico, Indonesia, Netherlands, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Poland, Taiwan, Sweden, Belgium, Thailand, Argentina, Nigeria, Iran... you get the point [https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/countries-by-gdp](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/countries-by-gdp)

They also have the 7th largest e-commerce market in the world. [https://www.business.com/articles/10-of-the-largest-ecommerce-markets-in-the-world-b/](https://www.business.com/articles/10-of-the-largest-ecommerce-markets-in-the-world-b/)

It is also the ultimate turnaround story. Up until the mid-1900s, they were a third-world Japanese colony, but in 2021 it is a first world country with one of the largest economies in the world. And they did this in about 40 years with their focus on tech and industrials as well as entertainment. Samsung, Hyundai, Kia, LG, KPop... (KPop is an international sensation right now - $564M export reported Aug 2020 last year and growing). [https://www.statista.com/topics/5098/music-industry-in-south-korea/#:\~:text=All%20in%20all%2C%20the%20South,to%20become%20a%20global%20phenomenon](https://www.statista.com/topics/5098/music-industry-in-south-korea/#:~:text=All%20in%20all%2C%20the%20South,to%20become%20a%20global%20phenomenon).

Also, just know how advanced they are technologically. They have had RFID chips a decade before us. They've had 5G for years. They have the best e-sports gamers in the world. They are no stranger to the worldwide web.

GETTING BACK TO COUPANG

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$CPNG is only cash flow negative right now because they invested 100s of millions of dollars into their infrastructure allowing them to have 70% of South Korea's population (36 million / 51 million) within 7 miles of their distribution centers. They can only do this because 50% of South Korea's population lives in the Seoul metropolitan area. Yes, 50 fucking percent. 25 million people. That's like 3 New York Cities side-by-side. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul\_Capital\_Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_Capital_Area)

South Korea's annual online sales is $37 billion and e-commerce sales of total retail sales 9.8%. [https://www.business.com/articles/10-of-the-largest-ecommerce-markets-in-the-world-b/](https://www.business.com/articles/10-of-the-largest-ecommerce-markets-in-the-world-b/)

$CPNG sales went from $6B in 2019 to $12B in 2020 (92% growth) [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/11/korean-e-commerce-giant-coupang-skyrockets-on-ipo/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/11/korean-e-commerce-giant-coupang-skyrockets-on-ipo/)

They also increased their market share from 18% in 2019 to 24% in 2020 (33% growth) [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/11/coupang-ipo-strategist-says-investors-should-consider-profit-outlook.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/11/coupang-ipo-strategist-says-investors-should-consider-profit-outlook.html)

So, if the South Korean e-commerce market grows at a 22.4%, it will be $142B by 2024.

RISKS & REBUTTALS

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They sell mostly their own products - OK they've got strong customer loyalty. Can they expand their business to incorporate more 3rd party sellers in the future? Potential is there.

Low gross profit margin - Retail has always historically been a low profit margin business. Is it possible for them to introduce a new high margin product or service? Absolutely.

Still cash flow negative - Did you see the revenue growth? $6B to $12B in one year. They're a growth company in its early stages. I also mentioned above how they're investing 100s of millions into their infrastructure (distribution centers within 7 miles of 70% of population).

They don't have AWS - It's not a literal copy of Amazon. They are also growing their e-commerce business before focusing on anything else. Sales went from $6B to $12B in one year. They need to saturate this market before focusing on anything else. It's highly likely they will introduce new high profit product or service in the coming years. Their founder is a Harvard drop out.

They dominate only in South Korea - What's wrong with that? Even with the South Korean e-commerce market alone, $CPNG can become a $500B company. They are focused on dominating their immediate market. I'm sure they'll create new services and create new sources of revenue. Once the Korean market is saturated, they'll figure out a way to expand. These South Koreans are smart and good at tech. Don't underestimate them.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VALUATION - PRICE TARGET

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If in 2024, $CPNG has a 40% market share, they will have $57B in sales (Amazon has 37% market share of US in 2020). With a conservative P/S of 4, that puts $CPNG FAIR VALUE at $133 PER SHARE ($57B sales x 4 = $228B valuation). If they are doing well and they have hype, with a P/S of 6 (BABA has 6, CPANG has 7), then $CPNG should be $200 PER SHARE ($57B x 6 = $342B valuation).

And this is if they DON'T CREATE ANY NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. Think about that. No new products or services. Just purely their e-commerce business and it's still going to be worth $150-200 PER SHARE. If they launch an AWS-like thing or maybe another service that's just waiting to be discovered, they're going to do an additional $10B easy with the market share they have so add another $50 to the price targets.

As one of the technologically most advanced countries in the world, $CPNG is not here to stay. It's here. To takeover (South Korea).

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONCLUSION

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My thesis is heavily dependent on them expanding their business with new high margin products/services, but this is a bet I am willing to make (one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world, Softbank, Blackrock, Bill Ackman, Harvard drop out, etc.). I guarantee they will innovate.

Oh and even if it's not them developing something internally, they can always acquire a company. They're going to do billions in profits soon. That is a lot of money.

I have to talk about $CPNG (Coupang aka ""Amazon of Korea"" aka ""Chef Pang"" aka ""C Piddy"") because y'all need to put some respect on its name. It's one of the largest tech companies to IPO on the NYSE ever ($55B) and the largest tech IPO in South Korean history. This isn't just some company. It's THE company. How often do you get a chance to invest in the next Amazon of?

Some of its notable backers are Softbank, Blackrock, Bill Ackman, Stanley Druckenmiller, and David Frankel.

Before trying to understand Coupang, you have to understand South Korea as a country.

APE MUST READ

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

South Korea is a first-world country with the 11th largest economy (i.e., GDP) in the world. That makes them bigger than Russia, Spain, Australia, Mexico, Indonesia, Netherlands, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Poland, Taiwan, Sweden, Belgium, Thailand, Argentina, Nigeria, Iran... you get the point [https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/countries-by-gdp](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/countries-by-gdp)

It is also the ultimate turnaround story. Up until the mid-1900s, they were a third-world Japanese colony, but in 2021 it is a first world country with one of the largest economies in the world. And they did this in about 40 years with their focus on tech and industrials as well as entertainment. Samsung, Hyundai, Kia, LG, KPop...

1615732684.0,REIT,"I am not a financial advisor and the below is my personal assessment of how things could unfold in the coming few months/quarters. And based on my assessment, I have tried to draw up a plan which I think might work in generating decent return with low to medium portfolio downside risk. This is not particularly a WSB-ish post, just because I am trying to not go full retard with my money.

Assumptions:
1. Fed to keep interest rate low till 2023
2. More fiscal spend in the coming months involving trillions of dollars

Let me start by saying that we don't need to figure out whether we will have inflation in the near future or not. Let the bond market speculate on that. We just need to follow the bond market and its expectation of inflation. That's all we need to do in order to allow ourselves a better chance to make money right now.

If the bond market's inflation expectation goes up from here, so will the 10Y yield. If the bond market's expectation of inflation goes down or remain as it is right now, the 10Y will remain where it is or will go down.

Note: at 1.6 yield (current yield) one would only buy a 10Y if they estimate that long term inflation is going to be less than 1.6.

If the yield goes up from here, tech or broadly speaking Nasdaq will continue to struggle further. And value stocks such as financials, energy companies, consumer discretionary will continue to outperform.

If yield remains where it is, expect tech to bounce back in the medium term, but value stocks will still remain the favorites.

If yield goes down, which would be a surprise, tech will climb back rapidly and value stocks will probably experience a correction, since they have already run up a lot in the last few months.

I personally think there is a greater chance of yield going higher from here, so being in value stocks or reopening stocks makes more sense to me.

However, since there is always the off chance that we experience runaway inflation, I think it would just be wise to hold perhaps 15% of your portfolio in inflation hedges such as REIT, or in a commodity ETF.

If real inflation actually rises in the next couple of quarters, Fed might or might not raise interest rates immediately.

If Fed doesn't raise interest rates and lets inflation run up, it might do so because the Fed might believe it is a short term phenomenon. Anyway, if inflation does run hot above 2% targeted, expect 10Y to shoot up.

In a higher than expected inflation environment, equities usually underperform, historically. Tech definitely would not be the place to be in. Safe bets would involve: consumer staples, energy and utility companies. These are considered safe because these industries could pass on their costs to the consumer, so their operating margin doesn't get impacted. Financials would also do well if this scenario plays out, because their net interest income would improve, because of steepening yield curve.

Commodities should also outperform during this scenario because high inflation will drive up the prices of agricultural products, livestock products - gold and silver will become attractive as store of value, property prices will go up (REIT).

In this scenario perhaps you should start building position in the dollar (cash) and also be equally weighted between commodities/property and stocks (financials/utilities/consumer staple).

If Fed raises interest rate as a response to rising inflation, it will do so because Fed wants to cool down the overheating economy.

In this scenario of rising interest rates, expect dollar to bottom and for it to surge as long as interest rates remain high. Commodities and REIT will underperform. Stocks will experience stagnate return or maybe even a bear market. If so, your built up cash position in dollar should probably go into buying the dip of attractive companies.","Portfolio plan for the months/quarters ahead | in context of yield, inflation and interest rates (Open to criticism if you think I am wrong or disagree)",m4w73k,15,63,0.88,63,0,,DD,False,True,1

Quick recap last week Hindenburg yes we all know them and if you don't do some of your own DD made a short report on Lordstown motors $RIDE
This made the stock fall to $15 per share which is down 50% from ATH
Lordstown is one of the most legitimate EV companies out there. A major partnership with multiple companies like camping world and GM. This is one of the worst-hit pieces I've seen.

First off fuck short sellers. Lordstown motors is a truck company that is bringing much-needed manufacturing jobs to the Midwest US FUCKING A This is an American company hiring people in a struggling city so anyone who shorts this stock is simply anti-America. Seriously fuck you for profiting from the losses in small American manufacturing city's. Even if you don't think Lordstown is a good investment is is outrageously toxic to make money on the failure of fellow Americans.

This hit claimed multiple things that I will now assess 

Edit*: for all you retards that can't read in the comments find me an OEM EV company that has binding pre-orders I dare you.

1) there is no demand.
Claiming there is no demand for an electric EV truck is insane. EV is the future and trucks are part of that by claiming there is no demand makes no sense and it's as simple as that. the tesla cybertruck has 400k preorders and I am sorry tesla retards but your local plumber, an energy company, and farmer jack arent buying a cybertruck. The real bros of silicon valley will buy the shit out of cybertucks so they can use them to live in because they can't afford rent but ain't no real truck work is getting done in a cybertruck.

3) the truck doesn't work
There are many videos of working prototypes not rolling downhill that can be easily found with a basic Google search these guys are probably using internet explore and bing search engine to do their DD or they're just blind. The Endurance truck is entered into a 250-mile rally in April and will be competing. Why the hell would you enter a race if your truck doesn't even work no one could be that dumb. The truck did have some issues as one of the prototypes caught on fire but the keyword is a prototype. Yes, no way I didn't know that experimental prototypes fail a lot of that's the whole reason prototyping exists.

5) preorders are fake
No, they aren't they are not binding pre-orders that is true but name one EV company with binding pre-orders even teslas cyber tuck can be ""pre-ordered"" with a non-binding $100 check so don't try and argue this is any different no one in their right mind would lock into a binding contract with any new EV company and no one has.

This report has caused RIDE short interest to shoot straight up and if a prefect candidate for WSBs good olde fashioned short squeeze to the moon.

The bull case. I grew the biggest testies and doubled down on this bad boy during the dip last Friday. my position 350 shares 5 long 2022 $30 calls. Mostly all bought on Friday

1) All pre-orders are for commercial use, the 100k preorders are from companies to use as fleet vehicles and they do plan to work into the consumer market after they ramp production more.

2) They own and will produce in the Lordstown plant previously owned by GM which already has a 500k car per year capacity

3) I agree with your take on autonomy I think it is vital to an EV company and this is very speculative GM who has the cruise Autonomous driving system is a pretty big investor in Lordstown and the CEO of Lordstown says they have a great relationship and want to expand their relationship with GM. So I would assume sometime down the road this could mean the integration of the cruise system in Lordstown trucks.

4) The Price, in your video you said you think rivan and Lordstown are kind of competing, I think this is a bit of a mistake, first rivan is a consumer-first company where Lordstown is mostly in the commercial space (right now) and Rivan vehicles will cost much more than Lordstown. I grew up and still do live in the city of Detroit and follow the automotive sector. I know a lot about rivian being that they have an office here in Plymouth Michigan. Their cars and trucks have a more premium price and the Lordstown truck is only going to cost about 50k which is pretty good considering normal gas truck prices. The rivan will be more in the 70k range.

5) This is an obvious Biden play Made in the US in the midwest (Ohio) a state that democrats barely lost, this would be a great PR political move to hype this company up just to get more Democratic support in the state and the midwest all together

Finally

6) partnership with RV world, they recently partnered with RV world to act as a place to service their vehicles, as we know when Tesla first came out and still to this day have issues servicing the cars. This partnership means that the day the first endurance truck rolls off the line there will be hundreds of locations around the US where technicians are already trained to work and fix these trucks, not to mention that both CEOs mentioned in their joint press conference that there is a goal to electrify 5th wheel trailers to help increase EV trucks long road trip range and build EV RVs.

Thanks for reading my ted talk I typed this on my phone so fuck you if there are any typos I'm not fixing that shit.

# Trend Reversal = No More Dryspell

Recently SPACS and EVs fell out of favor as macro market headwinds took the air out of Tech and Growth sails.  With a large amount of EV's being suspected of being Vaporware including the Pink Elephant in the room TSLA, Capital ran from these stocks faster than your Sunday morning retreat from that pig shaped MOPED you don't want your friends to see you riding.  This all came back to a stunning reversal of fortune after Warren Buffet said Yield Curve is so 1920's and everything is fine, stop being a bitch.  FED said QE forever boys and I'll let you know when I stop buying mortgages people haven't paid for since the pandemic started. Cool Bro, so Last week we saw capital come back to growth and tech stocks acting like nothing happened because they have a nice personality and tend to bang well. You know what I'm mean.

This saw our beloved GOEV take its gloves off (and its pants) and fight like it had a pair.  There's a short squeeze taking place that I have written about extensively.  The stock price immediately reversed its course and has continued to appreciate dramatically based on the electric magnetism of a gamma ramp. Friday the empire struck back and then we gave everyone fuck tons of free money. BullHood and his best friend WeRobbin' is going to turn this market into Burning Man meets 28 days later. Strap in.

For real though Canoo spent this week as the darling of the EV class.  Not only did its [SP](https://u.teknik.io/nkXjb.PNG) outperform every other fucking EV maker out there. If there wasn't the Friday Short shenannigans this week the SP would have dominated them all from the moon.  I believe that we are seeing the emergence of the Tesla Hedge. Canoo is, in my opinion, strategically grabbing market share while staying out of the way of direct competition with luxury EV models. Its doing its own thing.

# Hypermasculine BubbleTruk drop dominates automotive world.

[BubbleTruk](https://u.teknik.io/ikfDb.jpg) was so fucking weird.  People had a strong feeling about it, hating or loving it... No one ignored it. Media has shifted significantly into covering Canoo's Electric Truck Release (Did fisker even do anything at MPG ?)  [Google news overflowing](https://u.teknik.io/44XGk.jpg) with articles in the past 3 days. Probably some pay to play, but whatever.  Check the plenty of articles with titles calling the Bangbus as a TSLA competitor.  That belief will be self fulfilling.  We are currently standing at the base of a significant change in perception [a trend reversal](https://u.teknik.io/4Zo6x.PNG) that will have long lasting positive consequences to valuation.  But competing with Tesla is not the only thing on Canoo's mind, Canoo seeks to corner the entire fucking truck market.  Lets compare.

**Canoo hasn't been this cool always.**  I watched the MPDV vehicle video and succeeded in not suck starting a pistol but only barely.  In fact, If I was long in GOEV and that video dropped, I would have by now.  Its clear that the CannooBro's fanbase has only survived because of California's strict gun legislation.

I am highly encouraged by Electric ChadTruk video because everything about it was better. The presentation, the lighting the guest, the reality of its presence.  There was something just so dominant about it where Canoo just showed versus explained to me why I should think its cool. Tony talked about taking his significant other out and his Guys on the jobsite.  This offends the westcoast hipster elite.  Listen, the fact that he didn't say ""My arm candy sextoy never drives"" means he's paying attention to the Mandatory Training PowerPoint slides. The MPDV felt like a joke you have to explain... like your portfolio's performance before last Monday.   This level of difference is indicative of serious corporate flexibility and an ability to create meaningful change when you miss your target.  Its not all wins but its how you roll with the punches that matters.

The following are some tickers I am watching come market open 3/15 thanks to finding some DD or conspiracy from some of my fellow autistic sex workers.

**NIO -** [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4lj4s/nio_bullcase_investment_thesis_plus_crazy_ogstyle/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) **go thank** u/jameskwonlee **for this**

* To be added to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in April. If this is relative to other brands they could jump almost 100% in stock price over the months following the addition to that exchange.
* William Li met with Sinopec (second largest Oil Company and owner of 30,000+ gas stations) in early February. During NIO day William Li announced a second gen battery station. This potential partnership would create battery swap stations at a butt load of Sinopec gas stations. Huge ENERGY profits not just vehicle profits.
* PT at $60 from Mizuho and $70 from Deutsche Bank.
   * PLAY FOR LEAP CALL OPTIONS and simply more shares
   * $70-80 EOY Options
   * $50 short term summer calls seem pretty easy tendies as well

&#x200B;

**PLTR – why the fuck didn’t I buy sooner, might as well buy some fucking shares now**

* Stock is crazy hyped. Mainline that stimmy money plus Cathie Wood continuing to buy so why in the fuck have I been jerking off and not buying. My wife’s boyfriend is very disappointed in me.
   * Shares entry \~$25ish
   * Short Term Calls for YOLO sake

&#x200B;

**RKT – thanks to** u/bosshax **for his** [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m496ec/gme_and_rkt_short_selling_not_allowed_on_td/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**. This ape appreciated the photos**

* Still a huge short position in this company with many expecting another squeeze
* TD Ameritrade is not allowing for short positions of GME or RKT at this time so all the bears can get fucked
* THE FUCKING TICKER IS RKT!?!? 🚀🚀🚀
   * Shares entry \~$25
   * Short Term Calls are fucking cheap

&#x200B;

* Maybe the wholesale ultimatum doesn't mean shit to RKT but it at least seemed like some petty shit I was down with. Could be a big swing in price either way with those going into effect 3/15
* Being listed on new indexes on March 22
* Short interest seems to be ~~around 11%~~ **28% !!!!!!!**
   * Low entry price \~$9 a share so could have for a longer hold to see if anything pops

* MVIS's LiDAR product is in MSFT's Hololens being hyped as the potential tech that allows for self-driving cars to be propelled to the forefront
* Jumped 40% last week in share price
* Bullish outlook on call pricing even 5 months out

Following on my comment earlier today, I asked if there was any interest in some bullshit TA for next week since the entire WSB front page is full of legit DD including all kind of mammal pictures. 

I’m going to keep it as clean and simple as I can using area charts instead of candles. I believe support and resistances are better visible this way. It should help beginners see these levels at first sight. 

**Part I - Bull cases:**

**SPY**

Peaked through resistance and held. Common thought was resistance at 394.xx ATH while I drew my resistance line at 392.50 earlier last week. It held above 392.50 Thursday, resistance became support and whaddaya know a sharp bounce at 392.50 Friday intraday, turning green. Opened a new position on that support confirmation. 3/19 400c. If you're interested in learning charts, I recommend taking an actual look at the chart below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aim6y6vuzwm61.jpg?width=1548&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f63851b772f2bbf8cc7fd3a5cccd38d4d6f9c95f

**Bull Scenario A:**

SPY opens red and tests 392.50-393 Monday again, holds and closes above 396. If this plays out, we’re likely see the 400 breach Tuesday intraday. I won’t be spooked by the Monday dip. Might actually add. 

**Bull Scenario B:**

No repetitive back test. Face ripping rally above 400. 

Who would think folks will get their stimmy this weekend and the forbidden digital asset will trade above $60K? Honestly guys, this was kinda obvious. Not saying retail is single-handedly causing this. In my opinion, institutions anticipating this move is behind the $60K breach. I bet if we look at today’s buying blocks next week, we will see double digit unit purchases dominating fraction buys. This will be the confirmation of institution involvement, bringing retail inside.

Anyway,

$60K+, VIX potential $20 break down, QQQ short term bottom(?) and current market momentum pointing SPY 400 Monday. Many more detailed indicators (Bullish MACD cross overs, call/put ratios, percentage of tickers above 200 moving average inside SPY etc.) supporting this but explaining them without a video is not practical. 

Continuing on scenario B...Test 402 Monday intraday, rejection, test 404 (actual resistance) Tuesday and a sharp rejection. This is where I’m hoping to exit my 400c position and go short term 🌈🐻. Monday closing above 400 (or not) will be the deciding factor. 

**VIX**

Fellas this part is important. Spend some time on the chart below. VIX is very close to the infamous $20 support. Last time that support was tested, bears raped EVERYONE. They took no prisoners. I’d like to point out that last time it was under 20 was **more than a year ago.** Rules apply. VIX goes up, stocks goes down and vice versa. AKA fear indicator. If VIX goes below 20, which is a big event, **Bull Scenario B** will apply 100%.

https://preview.redd.it/e7kms0qy2xm61.jpg?width=1550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=743d02ae122887214dbfcf976d2ffbb2a7f4aa0b

**QQQ**

I think we’ve all learned the last 3 weeks that portfolio diversification is a real thing 🙃 

While QQQ is still sitting at a bear territory, it showed signs of a likely short term bottom. Mighty 323 resistance (double top) and 311 is the VERY important support. I believe it’s going to follow the rest of the crowd, breaking key resistances at 318 and 323. I will be on the look out for 318+ Monday premarket for confirmation. If so, above **Bull Scenario A or B** likely apply, thus giving bears little to no early hope.

**TSLA**

While 700 resistance is obvious, i believe 720 is much more important. 

In above Bull Scenario A, TSLA tests 688 support, bounces and close above 705. Tuesday tests 720 for real for real and hard rejection.

In above Bull Scenario B, pre-market 700+ straight up, taking advantage of pre-market low volume (I believe it did this at 800 as well) and blasts through 720. This level is where I’m hoping to exit my 3/19 700 calls. 

**TNX 10 YEAR TREASURY NOTE YIELD**

I want to cover this part in another post under bear cases. I think bears gonna love mid next week. I will be shorting financials and oil. 

If this was informative, let me know and I’ll continue tomorrow holding a big ass bear flag for Part II.

Fellas this part is important. Spend some time on the chart below. VIX is very close to the infamous $20 support. Last time that support was tested, bears raped EVERYONE. They took no prisoners. I’d like to point out that last time it was under 20 was **more than a year ago.** Rules apply. VIX goes up, stocks goes down and vice versa. AKA fear indicator. If VIX goes below 20, which is a big event, **Bull Scenario B** will apply 100%.

**QQQ**

I think we’ve all learned the last 3 weeks that portfolio diversification is a real thing 🙃 

While QQQ is still sitting at a bear territory, it showed signs of a likely short term bottom. Mighty 323 resistance (double top) and 311 is the VERY important support. I believe it’s going to follow the rest of the crowd, breaking key resistances at 318 and 323. I will be on the look out for 318+ Monday premarket for confirmation. If so, above **Bull Scenario A or B** likely apply, thus giving bears little to no early hope.

**TSLA**

While 700 resistance is obvious, i believe 720 is much more important. 

In above Bull Scenario A, TSLA tests 688 support, bounces and close above 705. Tuesday tests 720 for real for real and hard rejection.

In above Bull Scenario B, pre-market 700+ straight up, taking advantage of pre-market low volume (I believe it did this at 800 as well) and blasts through 720. This level is where I’m hoping to exit my 3/19 700 calls. 

**TNX 10 YEAR TREASURY NOTE YIELD**

I want to cover this part in another post under bear cases. I think bears gonna love mid next week. I will be shorting financials and oil. 

If this was informative, let me know and I’ll continue tomorrow holding a big ass bear flag for Part II.

MVIS had an earnings call on Thursday during which the CEO Sumit Sharma was noticeably excited and mentioned that the company was for sale several times, including direct quote “In conclusion, we remain committed to exploring synergic alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company, in part or whole, to maximize value for our shareholders.”

Here is a transcript of the call: [https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/34950d17-39cc-4cdc-87c6-b6714a06b89a](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/34950d17-39cc-4cdc-87c6-b6714a06b89a)

And here is the audio from the call: [https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/48120c74-0702-4285-bfd9-e8334da64933](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/48120c74-0702-4285-bfd9-e8334da64933)

I’m not going to post any DD because there’s already a bunch of amazing DD over at r/MVIS. I suggest you check it out.

There’s been speculation by longtime MVIS holders of a buyout for quite some time now due to their LiDAR (their product) being used in Microsoft’s HoloLens, but since LiDAR is also getting hyped as the technology that will make self-driving cars possible, some other players have emerged as potential partners / buyers. Again, check out all the DD on r/MVIS.

I’m posting this because WSB has changed my life. The only reason I have any money to invest is because of ideas from this subreddit and I want to pay it forward by contributing to the knowledge base. For anyone trying to find solid DD, sifting through all the posts, maybe not being able to afford something as expensive as GME - this is for you. I strongly believe in MVIS and think a buyout resulting in a huge jump in share price is coming. Good luck to all!

1615688163.0,LI,"Smart Nio investors trade on catalysts. If you guys read my DD on NIO before the NIO Day Catalyst, you would've bought in at 38 and sold around 60 (I sold calls, but still holding my shares).

Now, there are two new catalysts that are arguably even greater than the announcements at Nio Day.

**1) Energy**  
On Nio Day, William Li announced a second-generation Battery Swap station, where users don't even have to leave their cars. The stations are also a lot cheaper to operate, with greater capacity. They can complete about 312 battery swaps per day.

Imagine a world where Battery Stations replace Gas stations. What would that say about Nio? And what would happen to gas stations?

Well early February, William Li met with Sinopec's CEO. Sinopec is one of the largest oil and chemicals companies in the world (2nd globally according to Forbes). They have over 30,000 gas stations. Here's the kicker: There are not so subtle rumors that Sinopec gas station will incorporate Nio Battery Swap Stations. Nio plans to have 500 battery swap stations by the end 2021, some of which may be at Sinopec's stations. The growth in revenue will accelerate.

**Imagine if NIO's main source of revenue was from selling energy, rather than just cars.**

It'll send Nio's share price to the moon.

**2) Hong Kong Stock Exchange**  
Nio plans to list in the Hong Kong stock exchange around April. XPEV and LI will also be added. This is great news for Nio's stock price. An announcement about BABA listing on the HK stock exchange (around November 2019) led to its share price rising from 185 to 300 in three months.

The same will happen to Nio, and even more so, because Li and Xpev's rise will bring Nio up even more due to their coupling in various EV-related ETF's.

Watch out for an announcement in April.

**Other thoughts:** I've noticed, increasingly, that puts bought for the purpose of hedging positions are now mostly be applied to index ETF's like SPY and QQQ. Why? Because GME's short squeeze drama nearly killed several hedge funds. Sentiment Analysis has become a household name, and all the major hedge funds track WallStreetBets to avoid stocks that are too popular. Nio is one of those stocks that boomer hf's realize is one of the popular ones on ""reddit"". Google ""top reddit stocks"" and you'll see Nio routinely mentioned (this is also why I think stocks like PLTR will no longer suffer for too long).

Also Mizuho announced a Nio PT at $60, and Deutsche Bank recently released a memo stating that Nio can reach $70 in the near term. These things tell me that both retail and hedge funds are united in loving NIO stonk. We might be clear for another takeoff.

**3) What to Do**  
The dates on these catalysts are not announced like Nio Day was. All I know is that it'll happen sometime in the next few months. To play it safe, I would buy call leaps. My price target is 70-80 by EOY. Also, load up shares on dips and sell covered calls each time we reach new highs. I plan to diamond hand Nio, as I believe it'll reach higher than $300 in five years. I'll be buying/selling calls, but not sell my shares.

**4) Community Boost**  
If NIO passes $70 per share by eod, April 16, I'll donate to charity and post as an update. I don't want to virtue signal, but I hope it encourages some people on here to think about their community. I was inspired to do this by other WSBers that donated to the Food Bank with some of their GME earnings, so for that, thank you, and I hope I too can pass on the kindness.

**TLDR** \- NIO is likely to partner with the world's second largest Oil Company this year and have their newly designed battery swap stations operate in gas stations, thus Nio might actually make more money as an energy provider than a car company. Also, Nio will be listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which has helped stocks like BABA go to the moon in the past.

Looks like VXX was the right idea and I mis-timed the entry and therefore my strike. This was a good but hard lesson for me, but I’m excited because as you probably know by now my whole thing is learning and improvement. 

**Update 3/18 morning:**

*Whales to Watch: Revenge* edition coming tomorrow. If you think I’m taking this tier 1 whooping lying down you got another thing coming 😤 

**Update 3/18 Opening Bell**

Well, on the bright side, CS and DB are having pretty nice weeks 😬 😬 

**UPDATE 3/17 After Hoursish**

Before the close, there’s a lot of events tomorrow at spotrambo if you need a YOLO to wash the taste of VXX out your mouth like I do. 

**UPDATE 3/17 mid day **

🚨 JEROME’S COMMITMENT TO RATES AND CHILLNESS WITH INFLATION IS SENDING THE VIX TO GOD DAMN SINGLE DIGITS 🚨 

and guess what. I’m not selling. 

**UPDATES PreMarket 3/17:**

VIX? 🙏 🥺

Added a really interesting (to me) play for tomorrow at spotrambo.com. **SLDB** had two  unusual options orders on my non UW scanners yesterday for the 7.50 strike. [They also have a nice little conference pump coming tomorrow](https://i.imgur.com/qw8rxXu.jpg) 🤷🏿‍♂️ 

**UPDATE 3/16 close-ish (gotta run)**

Are ya winning son? Hoping for some fireworks tomorrow, but kudos to MA putting up a fight on a weird day. 

Yes I’m still holding VXX. Yes my heart still aches. 

PS Starbucks annual shareholder meeting up on spotrambo.com. Could be a play after today’s PT upgrades 

**Update 3/16 Open**

VXX absolutely ragdolling your boy, as is tradition. I’ll never sell because every time I do it goes 20% the next trading day.  

Thank God I found a tier 1 for next week I’m in love with. Also some tasty new events over at spotrambo.com to help you get out of today’s GUH like CRSR ALLO etc

**update AH 3/15**

Mixed movement overall with a couple tier 2 killing it BUT GOOD GOD VXX FADE ME FAM!

Bagholding with my held high for now. Somebody in the comments mentioned purchasing VXX Wednesday due to a nasty contango on the futures. I should’ve listened. 

**Another 3/15 morning Update**

Ahhh yea, VXX 😎 ☠️ 

****

**Update 3/15 morning**: There was some I really liked but forgot to mention here like AMD, they’re listed over at spotrambo.com 

Grabbed some VXX at 13.82 some NOK at about 4.30 and MA at 381.96. 4/1’s, 14 4.50 390. Grabbed more VXX than anything cuz I’m nervous. 

****

Guys, your boy AllDatDalton has a problem.  

Sure, it's a little fun when it pops, but after buying VXX and holding overnight, it always gives me the hangover of loss.  It always ends the same: my account is in disarray, I feel a sense of hopelessness, and everything in my life I'd worked toward to that point is eviscerated by terms like ""Stimulus Checks set to arrive...""

But *this* time...this time it really could be different.  **The FOMC is coming up this week starting March 16th**.  [For the unitiated, this is an event where not much is often decided but much is bet on; the FED gives their guidance in matters including—but not limited to--Quantitive Easing, Interest Rate speculation, and Bond Yield Curve control.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/think.ing.com/amp/article/us-what-to-watch-at-the-march-fed-meeting/)  Market volatility precedes it, as the oracles all scramble to determine what poppa Pow might or might not say or do—if the man farted into the microphone and walked away, VXX would probably climb 15%...the tension is *palpable*.

**This one couldn’t come at a more precarious time, as good news is now bad news**.  As reopening moves full steam ahead and we get a massive injection of economic stimulus, people are beginning to stop taking JPow at his word.  He promises a steady hand, he promises no interest rate increases, he says bond yield curve control is always on the table....and yet deep pockets flee en masse from stonks and into treasuries as the good times roll. 

**You see, the problem with the FED right now is no matter what they say, investors see the inevitable trend**.  They're betting there is only so long the FED can continue to artificially support the market--and only so long there will be reason to-- as indexes roar, the actual economy improves, and vaccine distribution is, for the most part, on track to return us to a world of pseudo-normalcy by summer.  It doesn't help that the FED stays verbally doveish while quietly doing things like declining to speak on Yield Curves definitively during speaking engagements, and [quietly ended the term repo m lending program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers). 

**My choice here is between treasury-tickers and the VXX**-- last time I was making this choice I went with VXX on the DD, and that choice didn't pan out until the second week.  I said then, reflecting on that week’s losers, that I should have chosen treasuries...**so why didn’t I this time with the opportunity right here?**  *VXX is just absurdly low right now, trading under $14*.  I'm not saying the pop will happen Tuesday or Wednesday, but it may, and dollars to donuts if you hold a VXX 14 or 14.50c 4/1 you'll make some money at some point if you don't hold too long after it makes a run.  Also, if Jerome breathes a word about Yield Control they will plummett. 

**This intro is also my way of admitting my confidence level this week is low—there is too much potential for chop**.  Sure, I could be wrong and we go to the moon once stimmies start hitting people’s accounts, and that argument is fair as I see some of the new age commodities mooning to ATH over the wekend.  But, for the most part, I'd rather put on a jimmy hat this week and hope my safe picks don't come back burning me.

But anyway, **you didn’t come here for my half-baked philosophy on impending market volatility.  YOU CAME CUZ YOU HEARD WE GOT THEM BAGGERS**.  So, let's talk whales.

**Shoutout to unusual whales who makes this possible through letting me share their pick info! They’re great!**

**Last week’s lovers**: **DKNG** absolutely crushed it. **Tier 2**, on a sustained measurement over the week, actually defeated Tier 1.  **OCGN SQ EBAY** all had magnificent moments in the sun aided by that crazy **4% NASDAQ Day**.

**Mid-week Pivot**: The **F** call mid-week was clutch on the 13c, and now it's sitting above that price to end the week.  Also, I know y'all were feeling the heat on that **T** mid-week pivot call, but Friday brought us the glory. I was sweating though 😅 

**Last week’s lesson**: **GE** and **DIS** were hotter than shit wrapped in tin foil coming out the gate on Monday, then they hit us with that nasty curve.  **News broke that GE was closing a huge deal on Sunday, which gave me continued optimism, and then they just demolished the call holders with that fucking reverse split**--if you say you saw that coming, you's a damn lie.  DIS got great news, but it was crossing a key 200 resistance number (is that TA?  I don't know man, I think so), and couldn't hold.  I **think the key here is it’s okay to take a pause on the pick if it’s hot fresh out the gate the week of the RAMBO.  There will be more picks.  The other lesson here is that when the event is big enough, it plays like an earnings rather than a pump**.  DKNG, for example, had pump written all over it.  It was more about future potential than earnings in the description. Conversely, the GE annual event had an ER feel, particularly in articles I read Tuesday.  **Meme stock pump event=good.  Boomer stock boring investor event=be wary.  Stock crossing a big round resistance number leading into an event=watch how it behaves, and if it dips catch it post-event.**

**”Never lost, just ran out of time”**: Someone pointed out in a comment the M 3/26 20c i went with from two DD's ago is puh-rinting.  Should've held I guess.  Womp Womp.

**Me two paragraphs ago**: I'm playing it safe this week.  **Also me**: Let's pick a failed meme that is a favorite of foreign bots.  

Someone in the comments on my last DD was pumping this, and I kinda didn't pay it to much attention at first.  But, they had some interesting things say about NOK, and convinced me that the foreign de-listing wasn't as big a deal as people were intimating. 

Sometimes you gotta plug your nose--*hate the stonk, love the RAMBO*.  **The general consensus around this event is that this is moment NOK needs to do SOMETHING to please investors**.  NOK is also sticking to the messaging that this a strategy reset of sorts.  The key pump factor here is *whether or not they will set a definitive dividend policy*--that's what I'm watching for.  If we get the dividend announcement, the sky is the limit.  If we don't, well, bail out quickly, because this sinking ship may head for Davey Jones' Locker (I'm so corny bruh 😭 ).

[VXX](https://i.imgur.com/CdGUT8U.jpg) (FOMC March 16-18th discussing potential yield curve control, etc)

The intro pretty much states where I'm at on this. **I like the 14c 4/1**--my plan is to wait for an assumed green open Monday, and see if I can pick up a nice premium price just before the classic fade.  **I’m going to hold until it pops, through the FOMC RAMBO**, and if the markets don't go red i'll probably trim some for a loss but keep holding for a level of general volatility.  If we open red Monday, I'll let action settle and push out to the 14.50c probably.  I dunno, I'm just a dog chasing cars.

Remember, this week could be super flukey, so long dates, timing your entry, and the ability to HODL are key.  I'm genuinely not excited about this week, not gonna lie.

**TLDR**

This week could be choppy with FOMC, so I'm grabbing some **VXX**, playing a longer **MA** call for a spicy safe haven, and buying **NOK** leading into their capital markets day as a purely speculative play.

**AAPL** has a rumored product launch coming on the 23rd, **CRSR** has an interesting conference, and **GPRO** continues to recieve bullish whale bets.

Guys, your boy AllDatDalton has a problem.  

Sure, it's a little fun when it pops, but after buying VXX and holding overnight, it always gives me the hangover of loss.  It always ends the same: my account is in disarray, I feel a sense of hopelessness, and everything in my life I'd worked toward to that point is eviscerated by terms like ""Stimulus Checks set to arrive...""

But *this* time...this time it really could be different.  **The FOMC is coming up this week starting March 16th**.  [For the unitiated, this is an event where not much is often decided but much is bet on; the FED gives their guidance in matters including—but not limited to--Quantitive Easing, Interest Rate speculation, and Bond Yield Curve control.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/think.ing.com/amp/article/us-what-to-watch-at-the-march-fed-meeting/)  Market volatility precedes it, as the oracles all scramble to determine what poppa Pow might or might not say or do—if the man farted into the microphone and walked away, VXX would probably climb 15%...the tension is *palpable*.

**This one couldn’t come at a more precarious time, as good news is now bad news**.  As reopening moves full steam ahead and we get a massive injection of economic stimulus, people are beginning to stop taking JPow at his word.  He promises a steady hand, he promises no interest rate increases, he says bond yield curve control is always on the table....and yet deep pockets flee en masse from stonks and into treasuries as the good times roll. 

**You see, the problem with the FED right now is no matter what they say, investors see the inevitable trend**.

**Mid-week Pivot**: The **F** call mid-week was clutch on the 13c, and now it's sitting above that price to end the week.  Also, I know y'all were feeling the heat on that **T** mid-week pivot call, but Friday brought us the glory. I was sweating though 😅 

**Last week’s lesson**: **GE** and **DIS** were hotter than shit wrapped in tin foil coming out the gate on Monday, then they hit us with that nasty curve.  **News broke that GE was closing a huge deal on Sunday, which gave me continued optimism, and then they just demolished the call holders with that fucking reverse split**--if you say you saw that coming, you's a damn lie.  DIS got great news, but it was crossing a key 200 resistance number (is that TA?  I don't know man, I think so), and couldn't hold.  I **think the key here is it’s okay to take a pause on the pick if it’s hot fresh out the gate the week of the RAMBO.  There will be more picks.  The other lesson here is that when the event is big enough, it plays like an earnings rather than a pump**.  DKNG, for example, had pump written all over it.  It was more about future potential than earnings in the description. Conversely, the GE annual event had an ER feel, particularly in articles I read Tuesday.  **Meme stock pump event=good.

**Me two paragraphs ago**: I'm playing it safe this week.  **Also me**: Let's pick a failed meme that is a favorite of foreign bots.  

Someone in the comments on my last DD was pumping this, and I kinda didn't pay it to much attention at first.  But, they had some interesting things say about NOK, and convinced me that the foreign de-listing wasn't as big a deal as people were intimating. 

Sometimes you gotta plug your nose--*hate the stonk, love the RAMBO*.  **The general consensus around this event is that this is moment NOK needs to do SOMETHING to please investors**.  NOK is also sticking to the messaging that this a strategy reset of sorts.  The key pump factor here is *whether or not they will set a definitive dividend policy*--that's what I'm watching for.  If we get the dividend announcement, the sky is the limit.  If we don't, well, bail out quickly, because this sinking ship may head for Davey Jones' Locker (I'm so corny bruh 😭 ).

The intro pretty much states where I'm at on this. **I like the 14c 4/1**--my plan is to wait for an assumed green open Monday, and see if I can pick up a nice premium price just before the classic fade.  **I’m going to hold until it pops, through the FOMC RAMBO**, and if the markets don't go red i'll probably trim some for a loss but keep holding for a level of general volatility.  If we open red Monday, I'll let action settle and push out to the 14.50c probably.  I dunno, I'm just a dog chasing cars.

Remember, this week could be super flukey, so long dates, timing your entry, and the ability to HODL are key.  I'm genuinely not excited about this week, not gonna lie.

**TLDR**

This week could be choppy with FOMC, so I'm grabbing some **VXX**, playing a longer **MA** call for a spicy safe haven, and buying **NOK** leading into their capital markets day as a purely speculative play.

**AAPL** has a rumored product launch coming on the 23rd, **CRSR** has an interesting conference, and **GPRO** continues to recieve bullish whale bets.

Looks like VXX was the right idea and I mis-timed the entry and therefore my strike. This was a good but hard lesson for me, but I’m excited because as you probably know by now my whole thing is learning and improvement. 

**Update 3/18 morning:**

Added a really interesting (to me) play for tomorrow at spotrambo.com. **SLDB** had two  unusual options orders on my non UW scanners yesterday for the 7.50 strike. [They also have a nice little conference pump coming tomorrow](https://i.imgur.com/qw8rxXu.jpg) 🤷🏿‍♂️

VXX absolutely ragdolling your boy, as is tradition. I’ll never sell because every time I do it goes 20% the next trading day.

Guys, your boy AllDatDalton has a problem.  

Sure, it's a little fun when it pops, but after buying VXX and holding overnight, it always gives me the hangover of loss.  It always ends the same: my account is in disarray, I feel a sense of hopelessness, and everything in my life I'd worked toward to that point is eviscerated by terms like ""Stimulus Checks set to arrive...""

But *this* time...this time it really could be different.  **The FOMC is coming up this week starting March 16th**.  [For the unitiated, this is an event where not much is often decided but much is bet on; the FED gives their guidance in matters including—but not limited to--Quantitive Easing, Interest Rate speculation, and Bond Yield Curve control.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/think.ing.com/amp/article/us-what-to-watch-at-the-march-fed-meeting/)  Market volatility precedes it, as the oracles all scramble to determine what poppa Pow might or might not say or do—if the man farted into the microphone and walked away, VXX would probably climb 15%...the tension is *palpable*.

**This one couldn’t come at a more precarious time, as good news is now bad news**.  As reopening moves full steam ahead and we get a massive injection of economic stimulus, people are beginning to stop taking JPow at his word.  He promises a steady hand, he promises no interest rate increases, he says bond yield curve control is always on the table....and yet deep pockets flee en masse from stonks and into treasuries as the good times roll. 

**You see, the problem with the FED right now is no matter what they say, investors see the inevitable trend**.  They're betting there is only so long the FED can continue to artificially support the market--and only so long there will be reason to-- as indexes roar, the actual economy improves, and vaccine distribution is, for the most part, on track to return us to a world of pseudo-normalcy by summer.  It doesn't help that the FED stays verbally doveish while quietly doing things like declining to speak on Yield Curves definitively during speaking engagements, and [quietly ended the term repo m lending program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers). 

**My choice here is between treasury-tickers and the VXX**-- last time I was making this choice I went with VXX on the DD, and that choice didn't pan out until the second week.  I said then, reflecting on that week’s losers, that I should have chosen treasuries...**so why didn’t I this time with the opportunity right here?**  *VXX is just absurdly low right now, trading under $14*.  I'm not saying the pop will happen Tuesday or Wednesday, but it may, and dollars to donuts if you hold a VXX 14 or 14.50c 4/1 you'll make some money at some point if you don't hold too long after it makes a run.  Also, if Jerome breathes a word about Yield Control they will plummett. 

**This intro is also my way of admitting my confidence level this week is low—there is too much potential for chop**.  Sure, I could be wrong and we go to the moon once stimmies start hitting people’s accounts, and that argument is fair as I see some of the new age commodities mooning to ATH over the wekend.  But, for the most part, I'd rather put on a jimmy hat this week and hope my safe picks don't come back burning me.

But anyway, **you didn’t come here for my half-baked philosophy on impending market volatility.  YOU CAME CUZ YOU HEARD WE GOT THEM BAGGERS**.  So, let's talk whales.

**Me two paragraphs ago**: I'm playing it safe this week.  **Also me**: Let's pick a failed meme that is a favorite of foreign bots.  

Someone in the comments on my last DD was pumping this, and I kinda didn't pay it to much attention at first.  But, they had some interesting things say about NOK, and convinced me that the foreign de-listing wasn't as big a deal as people were intimating. 

Sometimes you gotta plug your nose--*hate the stonk, love the RAMBO*.  **The general consensus around this event is that this is moment NOK needs to do SOMETHING to please investors**.  NOK is also sticking to the messaging that this a strategy reset of sorts.  The key pump factor here is *whether or not they will set a definitive dividend policy*--that's what I'm watching for.  If we get the dividend announcement, the sky is the limit.  If we don't, well, bail out quickly, because this sinking ship may head for Davey Jones' Locker (I'm so corny bruh 😭 ).

The intro pretty much states where I'm at on this. **I like the 14c 4/1**--my plan is to wait for an assumed green open Monday, and see if I can pick up a nice premium price just before the classic fade.  **I’m going to hold until it pops, through the FOMC RAMBO**, and if the markets don't go red i'll probably trim some for a loss but keep holding for a level of general volatility.  If we open red Monday, I'll let action settle and push out to the 14.50c probably.  I dunno, I'm just a dog chasing cars.

Remember, this week could be super flukey, so long dates, timing your entry, and the ability to HODL are key.  I'm genuinely not excited about this week, not gonna lie.

**TLDR**

This week could be choppy with FOMC, so I'm grabbing some **VXX**, playing a longer **MA** call for a spicy safe haven, and buying **NOK** leading into their capital markets day as a purely speculative play.

**AAPL** has a rumored product launch coming on the 23rd, **CRSR** has an interesting conference, and **GPRO** continues to recieve bullish whale bets.

Looks like VXX was the right idea and I mis-timed the entry and therefore my strike. This was a good but hard lesson for me, but I’m excited because as you probably know by now my whole thing is learning and improvement. 

**Update 3/18 morning:**

Before the close, there’s a lot of events tomorrow at spotrambo if you need a YOLO to wash the taste of VXX out your mouth like I do.

and guess what. I’m not selling.

VIX? 🙏 🥺

Added a really interesting (to me) play for tomorrow at spotrambo.com. **SLDB** had two  unusual options orders on my non UW scanners yesterday for the 7.50 strike. [They also have a nice little conference pump coming tomorrow](https://i.imgur.com/qw8rxXu.jpg) 🤷🏿‍♂️ 

**UPDATE 3/16 close-ish (gotta run)**

Are ya winning son? Hoping for some fireworks tomorrow, but kudos to MA putting up a fight on a weird day. 

Yes I’m still holding VXX. Yes my heart still aches. 

PS Starbucks annual shareholder meeting up on spotrambo.com. Could be a play after today’s PT upgrades

VXX absolutely ragdolling your boy, as is tradition. I’ll never sell because every time I do it goes 20% the next trading day.  

Thank God I found a tier 1 for next week I’m in love with. Also some tasty new events over at spotrambo.com to help you get out of today’s GUH like CRSR ALLO etc

**Update 3/15 morning**: There was some I really liked but forgot to mention here like AMD, they’re listed over at spotrambo.com 

Grabbed some VXX at 13.82 some NOK at about 4.30 and MA at 381.96. 4/1’s, 14 4.50 390. Grabbed more VXX than anything cuz I’m nervous.

Guys, your boy AllDatDalton has a problem.  

Sure, it's a little fun when it pops, but after buying VXX and holding overnight, it always gives me the hangover of loss.  It always ends the same: my account is in disarray, I feel a sense of hopelessness, and everything in my life I'd worked toward to that point is eviscerated by terms like ""Stimulus Checks set to arrive...""

But *this* time...this time it really could be different.  **The FOMC is coming up this week starting March 16th**.  [For the unitiated, this is an event where not much is often decided but much is bet on; the FED gives their guidance in matters including—but not limited to--Quantitive Easing, Interest Rate speculation, and Bond Yield Curve control.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/think.ing.com/amp/article/us-what-to-watch-at-the-march-fed-meeting/)  Market volatility precedes it, as the oracles all scramble to determine what poppa Pow might or might not say or do—if the man farted into the microphone and walked away, VXX would probably climb 15%...the tension is *palpable*.

**This one couldn’t come at a more precarious time, as good news is now bad news**.  As reopening moves full steam ahead and we get a massive injection of economic stimulus, people are beginning to stop taking JPow at his word.  He promises a steady hand, he promises no interest rate increases, he says bond yield curve control is always on the table....and yet deep pockets flee en masse from stonks and into treasuries as the good times roll. 

**You see, the problem with the FED right now is no matter what they say, investors see the inevitable trend**.  They're betting there is only so long the FED can continue to artificially support the market--and only so long there will be reason to-- as indexes roar, the actual economy improves, and vaccine distribution is, for the most part, on track to return us to a world of pseudo-normalcy by summer.  It doesn't help that the FED stays verbally doveish while quietly doing things like declining to speak on Yield Curves definitively during speaking engagements, and [quietly ended the term repo m lending program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers). 

**My choice here is between treasury-tickers and the VXX**-- last time I was making this choice I went with VXX on the DD, and that choice didn't pan out until the second week.  I said then, reflecting on that week’s losers, that I should have chosen treasuries...**so why didn’t I this time with the opportunity right here?**  *VXX is just absurdly low right now, trading under $14*.  I'm not saying the pop will happen Tuesday or Wednesday, but it may, and dollars to donuts if you hold a VXX 14 or 14.50c 4/1 you'll make some money at some point if you don't hold too long after it makes a run.  Also, if Jerome breathes a word about Yield Control they will plummett. 

**This intro is also my way of admitting my confidence level this week is low—there is too much potential for chop**.  Sure, I could be wrong and we go to the moon once stimmies start hitting people’s accounts, and that argument is fair as I see some of the new age commodities mooning to ATH over the wekend.  But, for the most part, I'd rather put on a jimmy hat this week and hope my safe picks don't come back burning me.

But anyway, **you didn’t come here for my half-baked philosophy on impending market volatility.  YOU CAME CUZ YOU HEARD WE GOT THEM BAGGERS**.  So, let's talk whales.

**Shoutout to unusual whales who makes this possible through letting me share their pick info! They’re great!**

**Last week’s lovers**: **DKNG** absolutely crushed it. **Tier 2**, on a sustained measurement over the week, actually defeated Tier 1.  **OCGN SQ EBAY** all had magnificent moments in the sun aided by that crazy **4% NASDAQ Day**.

**Mid-week Pivot**: The **F** call mid-week was clutch on the 13c, and now it's sitting above that price to end the week.  Also, I know y'all were feeling the heat on that **T** mid-week pivot call, but Friday brought us the glory. I was sweating though 😅 

**Last week’s lesson**: **GE** and **DIS** were hotter than shit wrapped in tin foil coming out the gate on Monday, then they hit us with that nasty curve.  **News broke that GE was closing a huge deal on Sunday, which gave me continued optimism, and then they just demolished the call holders with that fucking reverse split**--if you say you saw that coming, you's a damn lie.  DIS got great news, but it was crossing a key 200 resistance number (is that TA?  I don't know man, I think so), and couldn't hold.  I **think the key here is it’s okay to take a pause on the pick if it’s hot fresh out the gate the week of the RAMBO.  There will be more picks.  The other lesson here is that when the event is big enough, it plays like an earnings rather than a pump**.  DKNG, for example, had pump written all over it.  It was more about future potential than earnings in the description. Conversely, the GE annual event had an ER feel, particularly in articles I read Tuesday.  **Meme stock pump event=good.  Boomer stock boring investor event=be wary.  Stock crossing a big round resistance number leading into an event=watch how it behaves, and if it dips catch it post-event.**

**”Never lost, just ran out of time”**: Someone pointed out in a comment the M 3/26 20c i went with from two DD's ago is puh-rinting.  Should've held I guess.  Womp Womp.

The intro pretty much states where I'm at on this. **I like the 14c 4/1**--my plan is to wait for an assumed green open Monday, and see if I can pick up a nice premium price just before the classic fade.  **I’m going to hold until it pops, through the FOMC RAMBO**, and if the markets don't go red i'll probably trim some for a loss but keep holding for a level of general volatility.  If we open red Monday, I'll let action settle and push out to the 14.50c probably.  I dunno, I'm just a dog chasing cars.

Remember, this week could be super flukey, so long dates, timing your entry, and the ability to HODL are key.  I'm genuinely not excited about this week, not gonna lie.

This week could be choppy with FOMC, so I'm grabbing some **VXX**, playing a longer **MA** call for a spicy safe haven, and buying **NOK** leading into their capital markets day as a purely speculative play.

**AAPL** has a rumored product launch coming on the 23rd, **CRSR** has an interesting conference, and **GPRO** continues to recieve bullish whale bets.

Looks like VXX was the right idea and I mis-timed the entry and therefore my strike. This was a good but hard lesson for me, but I’m excited because as you probably know by now my whole thing is learning and improvement. 

**Update 3/18 morning:**

*Whales to Watch: Revenge* edition coming tomorrow. If you think I’m taking this tier 1 whooping lying down you got another thing coming 😤

and guess what. I’m not selling.

VIX? 🙏 🥺

Added a really interesting (to me) play for tomorrow at spotrambo.com. **SLDB** had two  unusual options orders on my non UW scanners yesterday for the 7.50 strike. [They also have a nice little conference pump coming tomorrow](https://i.imgur.com/qw8rxXu.jpg) 🤷🏿‍♂️

Are ya winning son? Hoping for some fireworks tomorrow, but kudos to MA putting up a fight on a weird day.

VXX absolutely ragdolling your boy, as is tradition. I’ll never sell because every time I do it goes 20% the next trading day.  

Thank God I found a tier 1 for next week I’m in love with. Also some tasty new events over at spotrambo.com to help you get out of today’s GUH like CRSR ALLO etc

Guys, your boy AllDatDalton has a problem.  

Sure, it's a little fun when it pops, but after buying VXX and holding overnight, it always gives me the hangover of loss.  It always ends the same: my account is in disarray, I feel a sense of hopelessness, and everything in my life I'd worked toward to that point is eviscerated by terms like ""Stimulus Checks set to arrive...""

But *this* time...this time it really could be different.  **The FOMC is coming up this week starting March 16th**.  [For the unitiated, this is an event where not much is often decided but much is bet on; the FED gives their guidance in matters including—but not limited to--Quantitive Easing, Interest Rate speculation, and Bond Yield Curve control.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/think.ing.com/amp/article/us-what-to-watch-at-the-march-fed-meeting/)  Market volatility precedes it, as the oracles all scramble to determine what poppa Pow might or might not say or do—if the man farted into the microphone and walked away, VXX would probably climb 15%...the tension is *palpable*.

**This one couldn’t come at a more precarious time, as good news is now bad news**.  As reopening moves full steam ahead and we get a massive injection of economic stimulus, people are beginning to stop taking JPow at his word.  He promises a steady hand, he promises no interest rate increases, he says bond yield curve control is always on the table....and yet deep pockets flee en masse from stonks and into treasuries as the good times roll. 

**You see, the problem with the FED right now is no matter what they say, investors see the inevitable trend**.  They're betting there is only so long the FED can continue to artificially support the market--and only so long there will be reason to-- as indexes roar, the actual economy improves, and vaccine distribution is, for the most part, on track to return us to a world of pseudo-normalcy by summer.  It doesn't help that the FED stays verbally doveish while quietly doing things like declining to speak on Yield Curves definitively during speaking engagements, and [quietly ended the term repo m lending program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers). 

**My choice here is between treasury-tickers and the VXX**-- last time I was making this choice I went with VXX on the DD, and that choice didn't pan out until the second week.  I said then, reflecting on that week’s losers, that I should have chosen treasuries...**so why didn’t I this time with the opportunity right here?**  *VXX is just absurdly low right now, trading under $14*.  I'm not saying the pop will happen Tuesday or Wednesday, but it may, and dollars to donuts if you hold a VXX 14 or 14.50c 4/1 you'll make some money at some point if you don't hold too long after it makes a run.  Also, if Jerome breathes a word about Yield Control they will plummett. 

**This intro is also my way of admitting my confidence level this week is low—there is too much potential for chop**.  Sure, I could be wrong and we go to the moon once stimmies start hitting people’s accounts, and that argument is fair as I see some of the new age commodities mooning to ATH over the wekend.  But, for the most part, I'd rather put on a jimmy hat this week and hope my safe picks don't come back burning me.

But anyway, **you didn’t come here for my half-baked philosophy on impending market volatility.  YOU CAME CUZ YOU HEARD WE GOT THEM BAGGERS**.  So, let's talk whales.

***

**Shoutout to unusual whales who makes this possible through letting me share their pick info! They’re great!**

**Last week’s lovers**: **DKNG** absolutely crushed it. **Tier 2**, on a sustained measurement over the week, actually defeated Tier 1.  **OCGN SQ EBAY** all had magnificent moments in the sun aided by that crazy **4% NASDAQ Day**.

**Mid-week Pivot**: The **F** call mid-week was clutch on the 13c, and now it's sitting above that price to end the week.  Also, I know y'all were feeling the heat on that **T** mid-week pivot call, but Friday brought us the glory. I was sweating though 😅 

**Last week’s lesson**: **GE** and **DIS** were hotter than shit wrapped in tin foil coming out the gate on Monday, then they hit us with that nasty curve.  **News broke that GE was closing a huge deal on Sunday, which gave me continued optimism, and then they just demolished the call holders with that fucking reverse split**--if you say you saw that coming, you's a damn lie.  DIS got great news, but it was crossing a key 200 resistance number (is that TA?  I don't know man, I think so), and couldn't hold.  I **think the key here is it’s okay to take a pause on the pick if it’s hot fresh out the gate the week of the RAMBO.  There will be more picks.  The other lesson here is that when the event is big enough, it plays like an earnings rather than a pump**.  DKNG, for example, had pump written all over it.  It was more about future potential than earnings in the description. Conversely, the GE annual event had an ER feel, particularly in articles I read Tuesday.  **Meme stock pump event=good.  Boomer stock boring investor event=be wary.  Stock crossing a big round resistance number leading into an event=watch how it behaves, and if it dips catch it post-event.**

**”Never lost, just ran out of time”**: Someone pointed out in a comment the M 3/26 20c i went with from two DD's ago is puh-rinting.  Should've held I guess.  Womp Womp.

When I said playing it safe I guess I meant it lol.  MA is going from your grandfather's favorite holding to an interesting FinTech play that is showing malleability in a fast-paced industry.
[They're doing cool stuff like this merger with Payoneer](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/fintech-payoneer-partners-with-mastercard-ahead-of-3-billion-spac-.html) and, for better or worse, they've joined the growing list of companies linking their perceived fate to the commodity that shall not be mentioned.  

I just generally like the stock, but I think this conference presentation will be a great catalyst as they have a chance to expose some of their new school thinking and get some nice quotes for FinTwit pumps.  Getting in early in case stimulus excitement waves can give a little push in banking and financial processors, but weary of entry because of FOMC.

**Me two paragraphs ago**: I'm playing it safe this week.  **Also me**: Let's pick a failed meme that is a favorite of foreign bots.  

Someone in the comments on my last DD was pumping this, and I kinda didn't pay it to much attention at first.  But, they had some interesting things say about NOK, and convinced me that the foreign de-listing wasn't as big a deal as people were intimating. 

Sometimes you gotta plug your nose--*hate the stonk, love the RAMBO*.  **The general consensus around this event is that this is moment NOK needs to do SOMETHING to please investors**.  NOK is also sticking to the messaging that this a strategy reset of sorts.  The key pump factor here is *whether or not they will set a definitive dividend policy*--that's what I'm watching for.  If we get the dividend announcement, the sky is the limit.  If we don't, well, bail out quickly, because this sinking ship may head for Davey Jones' Locker (I'm so corny bruh 😭 ).

Remember, this week could be super flukey, so long dates, timing your entry, and the ability to HODL are key.  I'm genuinely not excited about this week, not gonna lie.

**TLDR**

This week could be choppy with FOMC, so I'm grabbing some **VXX**, playing a longer **MA** call for a spicy safe haven, and buying **NOK** leading into their capital markets day as a purely speculative play.

**AAPL** has a rumored product launch coming on the 23rd, **CRSR** has an interesting conference, and **GPRO** continues to recieve bullish whale bets.

1615667478.0,TA,"**Update 3/18 pre-close**

Looks like VXX was the right idea and I mis-timed the entry and therefore my strike. This was a good but hard lesson for me, but I’m excited because as you probably know by now my whole thing is learning and improvement. 

**Update 3/18 morning:**

*Whales to Watch: Revenge* edition coming tomorrow. If you think I’m taking this tier 1 whooping lying down you got another thing coming 😤 

**Update 3/18 Opening Bell**

Well, on the bright side, CS and DB are having pretty nice weeks 😬 😬 

**UPDATE 3/17 After Hoursish**

Before the close, there’s a lot of events tomorrow at spotrambo if you need a YOLO to wash the taste of VXX out your mouth like I do. 

**UPDATE 3/17 mid day **

🚨 JEROME’S COMMITMENT TO RATES AND CHILLNESS WITH INFLATION IS SENDING THE VIX TO GOD DAMN SINGLE DIGITS 🚨 

and guess what. I’m not selling. 

**UPDATES PreMarket 3/17:**

VIX? 🙏 🥺

Added a really interesting (to me) play for tomorrow at spotrambo.com. **SLDB** had two  unusual options orders on my non UW scanners yesterday for the 7.50 strike. [They also have a nice little conference pump coming tomorrow](https://i.imgur.com/qw8rxXu.jpg) 🤷🏿‍♂️ 

**UPDATE 3/16 close-ish (gotta run)**

Are ya winning son? Hoping for some fireworks tomorrow, but kudos to MA putting up a fight on a weird day. 

Yes I’m still holding VXX. Yes my heart still aches. 

PS Starbucks annual shareholder meeting up on spotrambo.com. Could be a play after today’s PT upgrades 

**Update 3/16 Open**

VXX absolutely ragdolling your boy, as is tradition. I’ll never sell because every time I do it goes 20% the next trading day.  

Thank God I found a tier 1 for next week I’m in love with. Also some tasty new events over at spotrambo.com to help you get out of today’s GUH like CRSR ALLO etc

**update AH 3/15**

Mixed movement overall with a couple tier 2 killing it BUT GOOD GOD VXX FADE ME FAM!

Bagholding with my held high for now. Somebody in the comments mentioned purchasing VXX Wednesday due to a nasty contango on the futures. I should’ve listened. 

**Another 3/15 morning Update**

Ahhh yea, VXX 😎 ☠️ 

****

**Update 3/15 morning**: There was some I really liked but forgot to mention here like AMD, they’re listed over at spotrambo.com 

Grabbed some VXX at 13.82 some NOK at about 4.30 and MA at 381.96. 4/1’s, 14 4.50 390. Grabbed more VXX than anything cuz I’m nervous.

Guys, your boy AllDatDalton has a problem.  

Sure, it's a little fun when it pops, but after buying VXX and holding overnight, it always gives me the hangover of loss.  It always ends the same: my account is in disarray, I feel a sense of hopelessness, and everything in my life I'd worked toward to that point is eviscerated by terms like ""Stimulus Checks set to arrive...""

But *this* time...this time it really could be different.  **The FOMC is coming up this week starting March 16th**.  [For the unitiated, this is an event where not much is often decided but much is bet on; the FED gives their guidance in matters including—but not limited to--Quantitive Easing, Interest Rate speculation, and Bond Yield Curve control.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/think.ing.com/amp/article/us-what-to-watch-at-the-march-fed-meeting/)  Market volatility precedes it, as the oracles all scramble to determine what poppa Pow might or might not say or do—if the man farted into the microphone and walked away, VXX would probably climb 15%...the tension is *palpable*.

**This one couldn’t come at a more precarious time, as good news is now bad news**.  As reopening moves full steam ahead and we get a massive injection of economic stimulus, people are beginning to stop taking JPow at his word.  He promises a steady hand, he promises no interest rate increases, he says bond yield curve control is always on the table....and yet deep pockets flee en masse from stonks and into treasuries as the good times roll. 

**You see, the problem with the FED right now is no matter what they say, investors see the inevitable trend**.  They're betting there is only so long the FED can continue to artificially support the market--and only so long there will be reason to-- as indexes roar, the actual economy improves, and vaccine distribution is, for the most part, on track to return us to a world of pseudo-normalcy by summer.  It doesn't help that the FED stays verbally doveish while quietly doing things like declining to speak on Yield Curves definitively during speaking engagements, and [quietly ended the term repo m lending program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers). 

**My choice here is between treasury-tickers and the VXX**-- last time I was making this choice I went with VXX on the DD, and that choice didn't pan out until the second week.  I said then, reflecting on that week’s losers, that I should have chosen treasuries...**so why didn’t I this time with the opportunity right here?**  *VXX is just absurdly low right now, trading under $14*.  I'm not saying the pop will happen Tuesday or Wednesday, but it may, and dollars to donuts if you hold a VXX 14 or 14.50c 4/1 you'll make some money at some point if you don't hold too long after it makes a run.  Also, if Jerome breathes a word about Yield Control they will plummett. 

**This intro is also my way of admitting my confidence level this week is low—there is too much potential for chop**.  Sure, I could be wrong and we go to the moon once stimmies start hitting people’s accounts, and that argument is fair as I see some of the new age commodities mooning to ATH over the wekend.  But, for the most part, I'd rather put on a jimmy hat this week and hope my safe picks don't come back burning me.

But anyway, **you didn’t come here for my half-baked philosophy on impending market volatility.  YOU CAME CUZ YOU HEARD WE GOT THEM BAGGERS**.  So, let's talk whales.

***

**Shoutout to unusual whales who makes this possible through letting me share their pick info! They’re great!**

**Last week’s lovers**: **DKNG** absolutely crushed it. **Tier 2**, on a sustained measurement over the week, actually defeated Tier 1.  **OCGN SQ EBAY** all had magnificent moments in the sun aided by that crazy **4% NASDAQ Day**.

**Mid-week Pivot**: The **F** call mid-week was clutch on the 13c, and now it's sitting above that price to end the week.  Also, I know y'all were feeling the heat on that **T** mid-week pivot call, but Friday brought us the glory. I was sweating though 😅 

**Last week’s lesson**: **GE** and **DIS** were hotter than shit wrapped in tin foil coming out the gate on Monday, then they hit us with that nasty curve.  **News broke that GE was closing a huge deal on Sunday, which gave me continued optimism, and then they just demolished the call holders with that fucking reverse split**--if you say you saw that coming, you's a damn lie.  DIS got great news, but it was crossing a key 200 resistance number (is that TA?  I don't know man, I think so), and couldn't hold.  I **think the key here is it’s okay to take a pause on the pick if it’s hot fresh out the gate the week of the RAMBO.  There will be more picks.  The other lesson here is that when the event is big enough, it plays like an earnings rather than a pump**.  DKNG, for example, had pump written all over it.  It was more about future potential than earnings in the description. Conversely, the GE annual event had an ER feel, particularly in articles I read Tuesday.  **Meme stock pump event=good.  Boomer stock boring investor event=be wary.  Stock crossing a big round resistance number leading into an event=watch how it behaves, and if it dips catch it post-event.**

**”Never lost, just ran out of time”**: Someone pointed out in a comment the M 3/26 20c i went with from two DD's ago is puh-rinting.  Should've held I guess.  Womp Womp.

**Tier 1**: Dice I'm Rolling with this Week (intriguing whale bets, with RAMBO (non-ER pumps), sectors or tickers I like) *disclaimer: this may be choppy as week enter positions on dips, long dates*

[MA](https://i.imgur.com/ufR3TrB.jpg) ([3/23 B of A electronic payments symposium](https://investor.mastercard.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))

When I said playing it safe I guess I meant it lol.  MA is going from your grandfather's favorite holding to an interesting FinTech play that is showing malleability in a fast-paced industry.
[They're doing cool stuff like this merger with Payoneer](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/fintech-payoneer-partners-with-mastercard-ahead-of-3-billion-spac-.html) and, for better or worse, they've joined the growing list of companies linking their perceived fate to the commodity that shall not be mentioned.  

I just generally like the stock, but I think this conference presentation will be a great catalyst as they have a chance to expose some of their new school thinking and get some nice quotes for FinTwit pumps.  Getting in early in case stimulus excitement waves can give a little push in banking and financial processors, but weary of entry because of FOMC.

[NOK](https://i.imgur.com/EL3aSk8.jpg) ([Nokia Capital Markets Day 3/18](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news-and-events/events-calendar/investor-relations-events/capital-markets-day/))

**Me two paragraphs ago**: I'm playing it safe this week.  **Also me**: Let's pick a failed meme that is a favorite of foreign bots.  

Someone in the comments on my last DD was pumping this, and I kinda didn't pay it to much attention at first.  But, they had some interesting things say about NOK, and convinced me that the foreign de-listing wasn't as big a deal as people were intimating. 

Sometimes you gotta plug your nose--*hate the stonk, love the RAMBO*.  **The general consensus around this event is that this is moment NOK needs to do SOMETHING to please investors**.  NOK is also sticking to the messaging that this a strategy reset of sorts.  The key pump factor here is *whether or not they will set a definitive dividend policy*--that's what I'm watching for.  If we get the dividend announcement, the sky is the limit.  If we don't, well, bail out quickly, because this sinking ship may head for Davey Jones' Locker (I'm so corny bruh 😭 ).

[Somebody did a solid DD write-up on NOK](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m33vsq/full_diligence_post_on_nokia_nok_ahead_of_capital/) pre-event at r/investing.  I'm sure the sub will be appalled that I'm mining their shit for options speculation lol.

[VXX](https://i.imgur.com/CdGUT8U.jpg) (FOMC March 16-18th discussing potential yield curve control, etc)

The intro pretty much states where I'm at on this. **I like the 14c 4/1**--my plan is to wait for an assumed green open Monday, and see if I can pick up a nice premium price just before the classic fade.  **I’m going to hold until it pops, through the FOMC RAMBO**, and if the markets don't go red i'll probably trim some for a loss but keep holding for a level of general volatility.  If we open red Monday, I'll let action settle and push out to the 14.50c probably.  I dunno, I'm just a dog chasing cars.

1615661357.0,VERY,"This will be long apes so please bull with me. This is going to be a breakdown of GME's chart from a technical perspective as well as my thoughts on the short interest and where this is all going. I would just like to apologize in advance for all of the lines on my charts. I am fucking retarded and my smooth brain needs lots of lines, but I'll try to make it easy to understand.

**Technical breakdown:**

On the 20 day chart, we can see that GME is going up in a stair-step pattern, which is obviously extremely bullish. A stair-step pattern is where it rises up, consolidates lightly, then uses the previous resistance as support for the next stair-step. We are currently in a consolidation phase of that stair-step. As you can see, the red lines that I circled were previously resisstance but are now support. This is bullish.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sacw2jztcum61.png?width=2218&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ee1373bb21434559cf835cd9cc96e27d3151c9b

Next, and probably one of my favorite things, is the fact that on the day we went from 348 all the way down to 180, we had STRONG support at the 180 level, which, as I said above, was the resistance from the first step, which is now our support. Even better is the fact that our current consolidation is forming a pennant pattern from that support. A pennant pattern usually indicates that a stock will continue its trend (in this case up). This is extremely bullish, dare I say... apeish. The orange lines show the pennant pattern that I'm talking about and the two circles show the high and low of that pattern (lmao also kinda looks like a torpedo cock and balls). It's important to note that although the chart makes it appear that it will be breaking that pattern soon, the pennant could just extend, so do not think that it's going to break the pattern on Monday because though it very well could, it could also just continue consolidating:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5q6m693wcum61.png?width=2222&format=png&auto=webp&s=f323375e4cbe77a09f904504c074dadee2823c5a

When it finally stops consolidating and breaks this pattern to continue rising, the green line above should act as support for our next stair step, which would put us at 350ish for support, which is huge.

For the 90 day chart, you can see that a few weeks ago we broke the giant triangle pattern, which is how we got into the current bullish movement. Those lines are yellow:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7gwk7ocxcum61.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=1955427bbbc72fb02af1766c5a04ec80403e2960

Finally, in the chart above, I have marked the areas of CRUCIAL resistance. These are the fat green, yellow, and red lines. I made them those colors because each one that we break is more crucial than the previous one because of the last squeeze.

**What to take away from the chart action:** we are currently in a consolidation period of a stair-step pattern that has happened because we broke the triangle pattern that we started after the price went down from the last squeeze. This is very ~~bullish~~ apeish. Again, I apologize for all the lines, I'm a technical trader and I make a shit ton of support and resistance lines for my smooth brain.

**Volume**: everyone is talking about the squeeze, shorts, and price action, and blah blah but the thing that everyone needs to be talking about is volume. VOLUME VOLUME VOLUME. The ONLY WAY that any type of squeeze can happen is volume. I know that people don't like the VW comparison (and I'm not comparing them here, just using this as an example), but the squeeze was only able to happen because of tremendous volume

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iiet237zcum61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=82223652adfe00a84ee32197351b72cef79b9785

As far as GME's current volume, we are not there (but don't get down on it becuase WE WILL BE). The only way for shorts to be squeezed is for a major influx of volume to drive the price up significantly, forcing them to cover. In the previous squeeze, volume spiked tremendously and would have continued to increase if brokerages wouldn't have cut off buying. The CEO of Interactive Brokers even said that the price would reach over 1k if they didn't shut of buying, why? Volume. So, for GME's volume, it's plain and simple, it needs to increase (but I will not that the fact that the price is increasing so much without massive volume is even more ~~bullish~~ apeish).

**But Hank, how does volume increase?** Excellent question, tard brain. For GME, and most stocks but especially GME, catalysts are what drives volume up. Below is a picture of GME's volume since the January action:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rcu25cl0dum61.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d90f2c7ba53929f73b6dfbc02d2b9f23f84c7a2

The first spike in volume was in late November when Ryan Cohen announced his stake (but the jump wasn't super significant). The first big spike that you can see is on January 11-13ish when they announced that Ryan Cohen was being added to the board. In the next few days we see volume decline but still elevate compared to previous levels because of increased media attention. The next jump in volume (lots of red) is when Andrew Left of shitron had his week-long down-syndrome tantrum about GME and get his cheeks clapped by WSB. This giant volume orgy is continued for the next few days when Elon tweets ""Gamestonk,"" Chamath buys a bunch of calls, and other celebrities like Mark Cuban voice their support. We then see volume teeter off because of the brokerage cucks ass ramming us. The next spike in volume corresponds to when GME ousted their CFO (many thought that Ryan Cohen led this). We then see volume decrease a little. Volume the picks back up when GME announces that it has appointed Cohen as the head of their committee on changing GME to a digital company. Volume has since gone down a little, but the price has gone up (erection!).

**What to take from this**: Plain and simple, volume is king. Volume is your wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's boss's wife's boyfriend. We cannot have another squeeze without volume, BUT volume, especially in GME's case is greatly correlated with catalysts.

**Volume Catalysts**: Here are some potential volume catalysts that could lead to the massive spike that we need: GME appointing a new CFO, GME appointing Ryan Cohen as CEO, better than expected earnings, an acquisition, support/investment from big names (i.e. Cuban, Elon, Burry, etc), new committees/initiatives/anything relating to their digital transformation, quadruple witching day March 19th (still not sure how I feel about this and definitely don't think it's the be all end all that many others do but it could certainly help). Overall, it appears that the best catalysts are ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and digital transformation. Personally, I think that if during their earnings call Cohen announces he's gonna be CEO or announces some big digital move, that will give us the volume we need. It's important to note that it appears that Ryan Cohen wants this to happen (and why wouldn't he, his net worth is tied to it) as evident by the tweets that he's put out that, though cryptic, seem to be implying support of WSB and hatred of shorts. Roaring Kitty has also been very cryptic lately and it appears that he thinks something big is coming too (this is just speculation tho, I'm tard).

**TTM Squeeze and MACD**: Two of my favorite indicators are MACD and TTM squeeze. I don't wanna explain them here because I only have so many chromosomes available to me each day, but they essentially indicate momentum. On my charts, I combine the MACD lines with the TTM squeeze because they move similarly and I think that TTM is superior to MACD's histogram. As you can see, on the 1-year chart, the MACD is in a VERY bullish pattern right now. What I'm more excited about is the TTM squeeze (the colorful bars). In a TTM squeeze indicator, the light blue lines indicate that the price has extremely bullish momentum (it's in relation to Bollinger bands and keltner channels). When the bars turn dark blue, there is still bullish momentum, but it's fading. The red bars indicate bearish momentum and the yellow bars indicate fading bearish momentum. As you can see, are currently in some VERY Strong light blue bars. For a TTM Squeeze, there are usually 7-10 light blue bars in an extremely bullish pattern. From the last squeeze, you can see that there are like 5 really tiny light blue bars and then like 3 bigger ones. This indicates that we are currently in the middle of/approaching giant price action, but also that the current price action is better than last time and is forming a more stable, high arching uptrend. If you're thinking, ""oh man Unlce Hank, we've already had 5 light blue bars, the squeeze is almost over"" - not so fast tard. Though I said that there's usually 7-10 of these bars in an uptrend, that's not always the case, and going to dark blue bars simply may mean that we are consolidating and will go back to light blue bars. Overall, all this should show you is that yes, we are in a bullish trend and things are looking perfect. This is one of my favorite indicators and I believe that it's giving us INSANELY good signs.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4jopywl2dum61.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ac7c78bc7fcea8092f966f5a73c8fb5017f2ece

**A note about squeezes:** Let me be clear, if the brokerages wouldn't have cut off buying, this would have gone up past $1000 (IB CEO said this and he's a boomer-cuck). Because of this, last time was not a short squeeze, it was a gamma squeeze (or a series of them). A short squeeze would have resulted in a parabolic move to the upside accompanied by a parabolic jump in volume. Both the price and volume would look like very tall and skinny triangles (see the Volkswagen pattern for this). A short squeeze does not happen over time, it happens suddenly and very violently to the upside. Gamma squeezes, on the other hand, can happen over a period of time and can happen in small or big chunks. It's important to note that gamma squeezes can cause short squeezes and short squeezes can exacerbate game squeezes (it's a feedback loop, which is why it's so dangerous). So, currently I think that we are in the middle of a series of gamma squeezes that could lead to a short squeeze if there is a catalyst that creates volume.

**Shorts:** A lot of numbers have been floating around about short interest. Some say it's 13%, 27%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 120%, and well above 200% (I've even seen 900%). IMO, it's impossible to know right now. FINRA's release said it was about 50% and that's the one that I believe to be the most likely (definitely don't believe FINRA's 27% assplay). HOWEVER, it's important to note that those 100%+ numbers very well could be correct. The reason for this is because they can't take into consideration naked shorts (if you don't know about this there are 100s of DDs about it). So, IMO there are 2 scenarios here: 1. It's literally just 50%ish short interest on GME. Let me be clear, THIS IS STILL HUGE. Anything above 30% is huge, so 50% is still amazing and has massive short squeeze potential for GME. 2. It's actually above 200%. If the latter is true then the squeeze WILL 100% happen and will also probably crash the financial system because, as we know from 2008, when institutions get into these shady, unregulated derivative bets on volatile things, it usually creates a collateral effect. Personally, I have no clue which one is correct. The latter obviously sounds like a conspiracy but could very well be true because we all know how shady these funds are. However, it begs the question, ""why are they still doing this?"" The answer to this is they are either retarded (and not in a good way), doing it out of anger and spite (and we all know how well emotional trading goes), or they are in a bind and can't get out of it. Personally, I think that the conspiracy about naked shorts and everything is either extremely false or extremely true. If it's extremely true, then HFs are just kicking the can down the road hoping that we lose interest and the price decreases. If it's false, then we still have 50% short interest, apes, and Daddy Cohen. **TL:DR on this paragraph:** short numbers are conflicting and it's impossible to know which is correct or if the naked short theory is true. Either way, I like the stock.

**Closing thots:** The most important thing, as I said, is fucking volume. This is not just gonna magically happen. Sure, the price could very well keep increasing over the coming days/weeks on low volume and small gamma squeezes could happen, but until we get a surge in volume through a catalyst, we are not going to see the short squeeze. REMEMBER, the squeeze has not squoze until there is a parabolic move in price and volume over a very short period of time. I'm talking trading getting halted 5+ times in a single day on the upside. Do I think that these next few weeks are going to be very important, yes, especially next week and earnings week, but do I think it's over if not, fuck no! So with that being said, please try to avoid talking about dates as a certainty because it could lead to some of the younger tards selling because they're disappointed. Make sure to do what Rensole does and say that it COULD happen, that it's a possibility, not that it's the endgame or a certainty. Finally, continued talk about GME, continued buying and holding, and continued retardation are key. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, I SIMPLY HAVE A SMALL PENIS AND AN ADDICTION TO CUCK PORN.

**TL;DR**: I Like the stock.

EDIT: I also wanted to add that though GME's rising price action could be considered ""crazy,"" it's market cap is honestly not crazy. People usually get caught up in the price but don't look at the actual market cap. GME's current marketcap is only about 18B. Is that overvalued for where the company sits at this current moment? YES. But, if GME makes a shift to the digital space and becomes the go-to for literally everything relating to gaming (and possibly gambling), then a 100 billion dollar market cap is very reasonable. This is why DFV likes the stock. I think that he was originally in it for the short squeeze, but now I think that he is truly in this company for the long run because of its potential, and I couldn't agree more!

This is my first ever DD, with that being said please be nice, and let me know if anything is wrong and or if I didn't include anything important. Would love some **constructive** criticism, thanks. Also with that being said I don’t know anything about anything. I'm just some guy who read some stuff and compiled it all here. I can’t tell the future. I am NOT a financial advisor. I’m just an ape like all of you. PLEASE do your own research. Humans are known for being wrong and I’m no expectation. I’m bullish on this stock but it did JUST go public therefore there isn’t a ton of history for how the stock performs. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.

With that said. I hope you enjoy and learn something from this.

**Coupang Inc DD**

**Ticker - CPNG**

**Initial bullish info (for the apes who can't stand to read more than 100 words)**

* Talked about and known as the “Amazon of South Korea”
* Coupang has been the second largest e-commerce IPO since Alibaba
* Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018
* IPO jumped more than 70%
* Company was valued at $9B back in June 2020 and now is valued at around $90B with a market cap of 86B (at the time of writing)
* CEO’s a Harvard grad of the dropout (just like Zuckerberg)
* Coupang has the highest market share of Korea's E-commerce business
* Improved cash flow by almost a billion dollars in a year
* Similar to Amazon in early years with no GAAP profitability but massive cash flow
* Coupangs the most used online shopping platform in south Korea
* Coupang has continuingly growing branches in Food delivery and grocery services
* Coupang has same day and dawn delivery (place an order by midnight and get it by 7am)
* Eco friendly packaging
* Customer Base has grew by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Now for people who want wrinkles in their brain please continue on reading

**Quantitative:**

* Net Revenue for 2020: $12B up more than 90% from 2019
* Customer base Grew approximately 14.8 Million from 2019 to 2020
* Total net Revenues per active custom increased to approximately $256 in 2020 from $161 in 2019
* Gross profit for 2020: $2B also up more than 90% from 2019
* Operating loss for 2020: $500M down from $600M in 2019

Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018

2018: -1.5B

2019: -698M

2020: -474M

In November 2018 Softbank's Vision Fund invested over $2B with a $9B valuation which has since been increased to $86B

**Use of Proceeds:**

* Net IPO of Class A common stock was $35.00 and jumped to $69.00 (nice) once it was available to trade. However the company has stated they will not be taking proceeds from the sale of shares and rather wants to increase their capitalization, financial flexibility, and create a public market for their stock.
* Net Proceeds received from the offering are planned to be used for general corporate purposes including: working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures.
* Coupang is currently not planning to pay dividends and rather invest in themselves.

I really like this because they know exactly what and where their assets are and implies they will be heavily re-investing into those assets in attempts to grow them. Amazon has and is using the same formula by not paying dividends, not focusing on revenue, but focusing on growing their brand recognition and customer base (their largest asset). Amazon's TTM use of cash graph below which I predict will mirror Coupangs in the future. Again though, I don’t know anything.

📷

* **Profitability** (on a GAAP basis) was not positive. However from a cash flow basis they generated over 300M from operations and continue to generate cash flow in order to boost their operations and re-invest in themselves and grow their customer base, which continues to be their strongest asset.

**Opportunity:**

Korea's GDP “gross domestic product” (overall economic performance of a country, usually over a year) is over 1.6 Trillion and a GDP per capita (per person) of $31,847. This number continues to grow year after year as well as is evented form Korea's 2010 GDP of 1.1 Trillion.

The total spent in retail, grocery, consumer foodservice and travel in Korea was $470B in 2019 and is expected to increase to $534B by 2024. (Coupang is in 3 of 4 of those sectors)

Total spent in E-commerce was $128B and is expected to grow to $206B by 2024. On a per buyer basis, e-commerce spending is expected to grow from 2,600 in 2019 to 4,300 in 2024.

**Management:**

Range of age for management team is 36-61 with an average of age of 46

* **Bom Suk Kim -** Founder, current CEO and Chairman of the board of Coupang. Kim has a Harvard A.B degree in Government and is currently 42 making him the second youngest billionaire in South Korea. Kim founded Vintage Media Company (food industry exhibition and event planner) which he sold in 2009 before starting Coupang the following year.
* **Gaurav Anand -** Current CFO since Dec, 2020 and previously served as COO (Chief Operating Officer) from Jan, 2019 to Dec 2020. Anand has been with Coupang since 2017 and previously served as Vice President of Finance at Myntra (A fashion subsidiary of Flipkart (an online retailer which Softbank Vision Fund also invested into) and held various finance positions at Amazon from 2007 to 2014. Yeah. I know. Exciting right?
* \*\*Thuan Pham - (\*\*awesome name btw) has been Chief Technology Officer since September 2020 and served the same position at UBER from April 2013 to May 2020. From 2004 to 2013 he also served as Vice President at VMWare Inc which is a software and technology company. Pham also has both bachelors and a masters degree in computer Science and electrical Engineering From Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (this guy basically is a computer)

Other members of management have some pretty impressive credentials as well. A number of them have worked in high level management positions with Amazon like Minette Bellinagan who served as Director or Global sourcing and private Brands for Amazon. Many of them also have history in the technology and e-commerce sector with a good deal of them having experience founding their own startups such as Kiro Kyung who is a highly skilled software engineer who started two tech startups before joining Coupang.

**Qualitative:**

Company Mission: To create a world where customers wonder: “How did I ever live without Coupang?”

* **Same day and Dawn delivery** reducing delivery times to a matter of hours. (Like if amazon had the same promise of pizza companies with 30min or less delivery) People can place orders by 12pm and receive them by 7am the next morning with their Rocket WOW and Rocket Delivery program (similar to amazon prime and also includes groceries). Customers go to sleep and wake up like it's Christmas morning with their order right at their door. Same day delivery is offered for FREE, 365 days a year even the night before Christmas if needed. Customers can order anything from tomatoes to TVs for free next day delivery (better than any other delivery e-commerce players in Korea). 70% of the population (mostly in Seoul) lives within 7 miles of a Coupang distribution center. Operations span over 25 million sq ft across 30 cities.
* **Effortless returns** by tapping a few buttons on the app or website and leaving the item outside for pickup. No repackaging, no labels, no post office trips. Just leave it outside and any delivery truck nearby will come pick it up within hours. (much easier than amazon, eBay, UPS, FedEx, etc.)
* **Eco-friendly Packaging** cuts down the use of cardboard boxes by more than 75%. Items are delivered in a simple sleeve and sorted into protective bins. Eco-friendly bags that are completely reusable and replace almost all disposable packaging. The reusable bags are picked up by the delivery network for further use. Trucks leave full of products and rather than coming back empty, they arrive with returned packages, and the packaging of other orders which are then immediately used once again for another delivery.
* **Employees** work 5 day work weeks instead of the industry standard 6. Employees are provided with paid time off and full benefits. (amazon employees don't even get Amazon Prime. Amazon employees also have not reported the best working conditions. “People aren't the friendliest” “you're expected to work like a machine” “Work life balance can be hard” “needs more benefits'' etc.) Coupang Inc will also be granting their frontline workers more than $90M worth of stock and will be the first company in Korea to make their employees shareholders. 70% of suppliers for Coupang are also small merchant and business owners with under $3M in revenue per year. In the pandemic, small businesses on Coupang saw their sales increase by over 50%. Coupang now sits as one of the largest employers in Korea with 50,000+ employees and plans to invest over $870M into building seven new regional fulfillment centers, creating a projected 50,000 additional jobs by 2025.
* **Dynamic Orchestration** meaning their technology predicts and assigns the fastest and most efficient path for delivery drivers out of hundreds of millions of combinations of inventory, processing, trucks and route options within seconds. Packages are sorted at warehouses into protected, truck ready bins making the loading process much easier and faster for drivers. (can get more orders out faster.)

**Services:**

* **Rocket WOW Membership** is a flat monthly fee membership program which offers unlimited free shipping within hours of a placed order, dawn delivery, free unlimited returns for 30 days and **Rocket Fresh** groceries which has become the nation wide leading online grocer. The subscription based delivery was launched in October of 2018 and only costs $2.60! Within the first week of launch the service had over 150,000 users sign up and now has more than 1.2M users.
* **Rocket Delivery** is Coupangs FREE next day delivery service and the company has said to be delivering close to 2 million products per day which is the highest figure seen since the service was launched in March of 2014. Rocket Delivery continues to be the driving force for Coupang with people constantly wanting things faster, rocket delivery is a promise to customers that they will get their products on time, and when they need them.
* **Coupang Play** is a streaming platform branch of Coupang that is offered to their WOW members at no additional cost. Coupang Play is currently available for android users and is expected to be supported by IOS systems sometime this year as well as expanding into smart TVs and PCs. Coupang play has everything from Hollywood movies like the Spider-Man series and “Bombshell'' to popular Korean movies and TV shows. (I’d name them but I don’t think any of us know what they are). Coupang play also has documentaries, educational videos, kids shows, and animations with features like kids mode and parental locks. Coupang play is in the market for exclusivity as well with being the ONLY streaming service in Korea where users are able to watch things like Bryan Cranston's show “Your Honor” and CNN 10. Stephen Kim, the head of Coupang Play is also on record for saying *“We are eager to bring content such as Coupang Play Originals to expand our offerings and make this new service even more enjoyable and convenient for our customers.”*
* **Coupang Eats** has also been launched which is now the largest online food delivery service in Korea, which delivers food to customers using only delivery partners directly contracted by Coupang. Coupang Eats also incorporates the tech and infrastructure used for Rocket Delivery and Rocket Fresh making delivery as fast, and efficient as possible.
* **Coupangs customer centricity** continues to be their most important asset as 70% of the population is 7 miles from a distribution center. The company has vocally admitted this and consistently and continues to *“pursue operational excellence and innovation”* in order to grow this asset and keep the customers they have. Customer Base has also grown by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Part of Coupangs business model states all of this and I would have re-worded it but it truly is perfect and I don’t think I could have done a better job. When I first read this part of their business model it only furthered my confidence in this company. Not to mention again that this is VERY similar to how Amazon approached their business in the early years. The statement is as follows: *“We believe the true measure of our success will be shareholder value created over the long term. Our long-term investments in building a differentiated technology-orchestrated network and customer-facing functionality have helped build a business that we expect will deliver significant growth and cash flows at scale. We have in turn reinvested to expand into new offerings successfully, such as with our owned-inventory selection, Rocket WOW membership, Rocket Fresh, and Coupang Eats, among others. We will continue to reinvest cash flows generated by our established offerings into new initiatives and innovations for our customers. We will choose to invest and maximize value for customers and shareholders in the long term over optimizing our short-term results.”*

**Top Risks:**

* Coupang is rapidly evolving which could lead to the inability to manage the growth
* Coupang plans to forgo short term financial performance for long term growth (Same strategy as Amazon so in my eyes not a downside)
* **Dilution:** The company has stated that there will be (was) immediate stock dilution to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price. Though dilution is sometimes seen as a bad thing, out of all the evidence from Coupang and the business model we know they are going to follow, I believe that this dilution is simply to raise money for further expansion. I believe this dilution is why Coupang had a red day on Friday and may continue to be red for the next few weeks or so as it levels out. This does not change my stance on the stock at all just thought it was an interesting point to mention since dilution can be seen as a bad thing as companies sometimes do this in desperation when they may simply need more money to cover expenses. However I think it would be stupid to assume this is the case with Coupang as it is consistently growing its assets and shows no sign of bleeding, as well as just going public. Still though, it lessens shareholders position and lowers P/E which is a measure of profitability, but again, we know Coupang is not focusing on this at the moment. All this changes in my eyes is that I’m going to watch the stock closely over the next few weeks and months to see where it starts to even out and show signs of uptrends and or downtrends.

I have tried looking around for other reasons why Coupang could fail or simply why it could truly not be the next amazon of south Korea but I have yet to find any info. If anyone does, a link would be greatly appreciated and I will edit with new info.

**TDLR:**

In my OPINION, based on everything I’ve read and compiled here, I truly think Coupang has Unlimited potential. The company has continued to show strong growth and belief in itself. It's constantly expanding into new territories as is evident with Coupang Play and Rocket Fresh as well as consistently growing their main assets. Their management team looks very Promising with backgrounds in Amazon, Uber, and A fuck load of computer engineering. Year after year revenue has been up, customer base has been up, and operating loss and net loss have been down. This company looks very promising in my eyes and I definitely will be investing in Coupang in years to come.

Thanks to everyone who stuck through all this. Again it's my first ever DD so hopefully it's not too shit. I put a lot of effort and research into this and I hope y'all gain some insight to this awesome company. PLEASE let me know if there's anything I should’ve included in this, I am hoping to get a lot better at this whole “stonks” thing. As you may have noticed I haven’t given any info on my position with the stock and that is honestly, simply because I’m waiting for my next paycheck so I can afford to buy some. I currently don’t own shares in Coupang but you can bet your ass I’m buying as much as I can the next time I have money to throw at the market. Wouldn’t you want to get into Amazon in 2005?

Thanks again, Onions. THIS IS NOT FINACIAL ADVISE

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm sorry I cant reply to any comments, not enough Karma.

But I defiantly agree with the statement that Korea is small compared to the US and they will have to compete with Amazon if they expand to other Countries. Still don't think this means they can't be HUGLY successful in Korea.

Also I'm not sure when they can be profitable. 2024 maybe?

The total spent in retail, grocery, consumer foodservice and travel in Korea was $470B in 2019 and is expected to increase to $534B by 2024. (Coupang is in 3 of 4 of those sectors)

Total spent in E-commerce was $128B and is expected to grow to $206B by 2024. On a per buyer basis, e-commerce spending is expected to grow from 2,600 in 2019 to 4,300 in 2024.

The subscription based delivery was launched in October of 2018 and only costs $2.60! Within the first week of launch the service had over 150,000 users sign up and now has more than 1.2M users.
* **Rocket Delivery** is Coupangs FREE next day delivery service and the company has said to be delivering close to 2 million products per day which is the highest figure seen since the service was launched in March of 2014. Rocket Delivery continues to be the driving force for Coupang with people constantly wanting things faster, rocket delivery is a promise to customers that they will get their products on time, and when they need them.
* **Coupang Play** is a streaming platform branch of Coupang that is offered to their WOW members at no additional cost. Coupang Play is currently available for android users and is expected to be supported by IOS systems sometime this year as well as expanding into smart TVs and PCs. Coupang play has everything from Hollywood movies like the Spider-Man series and “Bombshell'' to popular Korean movies and TV shows. (I’d name them but I don’t think any of us know what they are). Coupang play also has documentaries, educational videos, kids shows, and animations with features like kids mode and parental locks. Coupang play is in the market for exclusivity as well with being the ONLY streaming service in Korea where users are able to watch things like Bryan Cranston's show “Your Honor” and CNN 10. Stephen Kim, the head of Coupang Play is also on record for saying *“We are eager to bring content such as Coupang Play Originals to expand our offerings and make this new service even more enjoyable and convenient for our customers.”*
* **Coupang Eats** has also been launched which is now the largest online food delivery service in Korea, which delivers food to customers using only delivery partners directly contracted by Coupang. Coupang Eats also incorporates the tech and infrastructure used for Rocket Delivery and Rocket Fresh making delivery as fast, and efficient as possible.
* **Coupangs customer centricity** continues to be their most important asset as 70% of the population is 7 miles from a distribution center. The company has vocally admitted this and consistently and continues to *“pursue operational excellence and innovation”* in order to grow this asset and keep the customers they have. Customer Base has also grown by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Part of Coupangs business model states all of this and I would have re-worded it but it truly is perfect and I don’t think I could have done a better job. When I first read this part of their business model it only furthered my confidence in this company. Not to mention again that this is VERY similar to how Amazon approached their business in the early years. The statement is as follows: *“We believe the true measure of our success will be shareholder value created over the long term. Our long-term investments in building a differentiated technology-orchestrated network and customer-facing functionality have helped build a business that we expect will deliver significant growth and cash flows at scale. We have in turn reinvested to expand into new offerings successfully, such as with our owned-inventory selection, Rocket WOW membership, Rocket Fresh, and Coupang Eats, among others. We will continue to reinvest cash flows generated by our established offerings into new initiatives and innovations for our customers. We will choose to invest and maximize value for customers and shareholders in the long term over optimizing our short-term results.”*

**Top Risks:**

* Coupang is rapidly evolving which could lead to the inability to manage the growth
* Coupang plans to forgo short term financial performance for long term growth (Same strategy as Amazon so in my eyes not a downside)
* **Dilution:** The company has stated that there will be (was) immediate stock dilution to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price. Though dilution is sometimes seen as a bad thing, out of all the evidence from Coupang and the business model we know they are going to follow, I believe that this dilution is simply to raise money for further expansion. I believe this dilution is why Coupang had a red day on Friday and may continue to be red for the next few weeks or so as it levels out. This does not change my stance on the stock at all just thought it was an interesting point to mention since dilution can be seen as a bad thing as companies sometimes do this in desperation when they may simply need more money to cover expenses. However I think it would be stupid to assume this is the case with Coupang as it is consistently growing its assets and shows no sign of bleeding, as well as just going public. Still though, it lessens shareholders position and lowers P/E which is a measure of profitability, but again, we know Coupang is not focusing on this at the moment. All this changes in my eyes is that I’m going to watch the stock closely over the next few weeks and months to see where it starts to even out and show signs of uptrends and or downtrends.

I have tried looking around for other reasons why Coupang could fail or simply why it could truly not be the next amazon of south Korea but I have yet to find any info. If anyone does, a link would be greatly appreciated and I will edit with new info.

**TDLR:**

In my OPINION, based on everything I’ve read and compiled here, I truly think Coupang has Unlimited potential. The company has continued to show strong growth and belief in itself. It's constantly expanding into new territories as is evident with Coupang Play and Rocket Fresh as well as consistently growing their main assets. Their management team looks very Promising with backgrounds in Amazon, Uber, and A fuck load of computer engineering. Year after year revenue has been up, customer base has been up, and operating loss and net loss have been down. This company looks very promising in my eyes and I definitely will be investing in Coupang in years to come.

Thanks to everyone who stuck through all this. Again it's my first ever DD so hopefully it's not too shit. I put a lot of effort and research into this and I hope y'all gain some insight to this awesome company. PLEASE let me know if there's anything I should’ve included in this, I am hoping to get a lot better at this whole “stonks” thing. As you may have noticed I haven’t given any info on my position with the stock and that is honestly, simply because I’m waiting for my next paycheck so I can afford to buy some. I currently don’t own shares in Coupang but you can bet your ass I’m buying as much as I can the next time I have money to throw at the market. Wouldn’t you want to get into Amazon in 2005?

Thanks again, Onions. THIS IS NOT FINACIAL ADVISE

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm sorry I cant reply to any comments, not enough Karma.

But I defiantly agree with the statement that Korea is small compared to the US and they will have to compete with Amazon if they expand to other Countries. Still don't think this means they can't be HUGLY successful in Korea.

Also I'm not sure when they can be profitable. 2024 maybe?

**New notes for data:** It's getting to the point where Short Sellers would litterally need to be 80% of all off-market and long volume trades to be under 100%.

I changed the formula for the cost of OM volume to match the lowest price of the days as the off market is mainly Darkpool trades.

**New Conclusions** We can conclude that the % of volume used for covering is far less than their average of 30.75% since the 15th of january as a result of a big ol' FOMO rally from retail and a bull effort from institutions hogging up that volume  Therefore, it is not crazy to derive that ***SI% IS OVER 700%***, with a cost well over 5 billion $ to do so.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:** What I found was a tendency for these Short Sellers to get cocky and not cover on weeks when you would have expected them to. This means some weaks with low SV% had HUGE net gains in shorts. This never worked in reverse in the data.

**PROOF THAT FINRA DATA IS IMPOSSIBLE**  If you were to take the FINRA DATA from the 15th of january to the 24th of February, you would find that they would've needed to Cover using 30-32% of all transfers for the entire month and a half.

*Proof 1: It would have been impossible for them to comprise that portion of the covering with the FOMO wave and GAMMA squeeze that was hogging the data at the time.*  This 30-32% is notable. There was a considerable boost in daily volume in that period. So, you are talking about a MINIMAL COST OF **34.46 BILLION DOLLARS** using my formulas from my previous data. That being the bare minimum amount... just to lower it to the SI% they said it was at....

*Proof 2: We have not witnessed a loss of* ***22.65 Billion USD or more*** *from institutions in that time. That would have been a net loss btw, no bankruptcies were seen either*  I said above that I noticed that Short Sellers did not cover when the data suggested they had the opportunity. That this trend never reversed, a High weekly SV% yielded a net gain in short positions.

*Proof 3: SV% has remained over 50% throughout the 15th to 24th period, which provides evidence of a net gain in shorts... not a complete dip of the SI.*  Lastly, if all this was the way they say it did, then...

*Proof 4: The stock price would not have dropped during the period if they had covered. The data* ***HEAVILY*** *implies that shorts are used and held to stop upwards momentum*

>Short volume % of total volume can't reliably tell you how many new shorts have entered or covered that day because below:A market maker selling you a share that they haven't yet matched up with an actual seller but do a few seconds later will get counted as a short position momentarily. This apparently can and does happen and gets counted in the short volume. Meaning exactly no new short positions were taken but the short volume went up anyway. (I believe this is actually explained on FINRA's website -[https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019))  On the flip side, it does tell you the absolute highest number of short positions that could have been taken that day so new short positions could be anywhere between 0 and the high short volume amount, but due to the above as well as shorts entering and the covering in the same day means you can't really gleam anything from it reliably. Sorry

1: What you are describing would create a net neutral movement on the share price, which was not seen.

More importantly, the data I aquired clearly shows that there was a net gain of shorts when compared to the long volume (which is where they could have covered) day after day after day. It is possible, but the data says that they have been creating more shares than they can possibly cover even if they were 100% of the long volume everyday (which, as we know, is 90% algos and day traders)

I look at things from a scientific lens. All I aimed to do was to show that it is financially and numerically ***IMPOSSIBLE FOR SI% TO HAVE LOWERED SINCE THE 15TH OF JANUARY***.  It was the running assumption that everyone who believed in this had, and I provided damning evidence for it being the case.

>This is not how it works Not saying that GME short interest is X or Y. But literally this is not how it works you really can’t use short volume to determine short interest.  INTERPRETING DAILY FINRA SHORT SALE REPORTS  Mods please don’t delete 📷 I’ve seen a lot of posts about FINRA daily short sale reports and what it means. Importantly it doesn’t mean what you think. This isn’t FUD it’s just how market making works.  TL;DR a lot of the short volume is market makers shorting to facilitate buy orders and they immediately cover with the next trade.  -High short volume in the FINRA report actually often reflects net BUYING. This is why trying to interpret these reports is pretty much useless.  -That sounds crazy but that’s how market making works. -FINRA report is only for off exchange trades (dark pools).

What happens is - your order to buy 100 shares of GME at market gets sent to a dark pool. The MM (a computer) SHORTS you those shares at $108.793 and then BUYS those shares back at $108.791. A short of 100 shares is recorded. This also explains how you see ridiculous volumes and ridiculous # of shorts every day for a stock that has a 50M float. The MM isn’t “going short” GME. They short it for a millisecond then buy a fraction of a penny lower a millisecond later.  -So high short volume in the FINRA report (which is ONLY reflecting off exchange trades (dark pools) does NOT necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting. It often reflects high levels of buying! Um. Like we just saw this week. Repeat that It does also does NOT reflect exchange trades.  You don’t have to believe me you can read this super interesting piece here. Generally speaking, the idea that large short volume in the report is good news for holders seems true! It’s just not for the reasons you think.

I didnt assume you were FUD, but it's a little sus when you open like that hahahahh  same as my answer for the last one, my data clearly shows that financially and data wise, there are more shorts being taken on most days, where the only way for them to even be below what they were on the 15th would be for them to litterally bankrupt themselves in the process.  What you describe there would have a net neutral effect on the share price. Share price plummetted as Short Volume exceeded long volume. That is the fact. The data disagrees with your rebuttal.

&#x200B;

>No, this post is misinformation. You cannot gauge short interest from short volume. Because a majority of short volume is closed in seconds. I keep telling people this. You should really make a wiki or sidebar notice about short volume. So much misinformation and misplaced hype because of short volume. High short volume does NOT mean high short interest.  To be clear, i believe short interest is super high for GME, but not due to short volume. There has been lots of legit DD done on this. But focusing on short volume is straight misinformation propagated by people who don't know what they're talking about.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Personally, as in u/moonski 's opinion,  the feedback from you all is excellent and whilst I am still sceptical of the high %s, and the *total accuracy* of the derived info, I still think it is very valuable in at least showing that reported SI is esesntially, total horseshit.

All we really have is S3 & FINRA delayed self reported data telling us SI is constantly dropping yet price action does not suppport such a low liquidity stock being covered from over 200% SI in January...

Also very weirdly the data goblin himself Ihor of S3 aka the iHorse (hes @ ihors3 on twitter ffs) tweeted yesterday that GME is a 10/10 on his new squeeze score aka the ""squeezeometer."" How this is derived  is ""a secret.""  So it's 10/10 squeeze potential yet SI is plumetting, at a mere 15% according to himself... mhm

Thus I am still totally convinced that SI is >100%, and this data shows that there is no way it is what is being report by the likes of S3 or FINRA is accurate. What we are doing here, if not proving to you what the magical SI number definitely is, is showing that SI is *substantially* higher than what reports are claiming.

I am also certain GME has a significant issue with synthetic shares due to the volume of trading being a significant % of the total free float size of 50m (more like 24m in reality). AMC, a popular meme stock trades at 30% float, and most non meme popular stocks trade far, far, far lower than this in terms of volume / float.

Interestingly I did come across this - SI was at **132% on Feb 8th**, according to S&Pglobal (you know, the guys whos name is in the S&P500) in an article posted on Feb 18 - [https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/short-interest-in-us-stocks-declines-in-aftermath-of-gamestop-saga-data-shows-62699063](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/short-interest-in-us-stocks-declines-in-aftermath-of-gamestop-saga-data-shows-62699063). They later claimed on March 2nd that SI had dropped to 24% ""in mid february"" which makes absolutely no sense given price action - 132% to 24% as the stock hoves around $40. Ok then.

All we really have is S3 & FINRA delayed self reported data telling us SI is constantly dropping yet price action does not suppport such a low liquidity stock being covered from over 200% SI in January...

Also very weirdly the data goblin himself Ihor of S3 aka the iHorse (hes @ ihors3 on twitter ffs) tweeted yesterday that GME is a 10/10 on his new squeeze score aka the ""squeezeometer."" How this is derived  is ""a secret.""  So it's 10/10 squeeze potential yet SI is plumetting, at a mere 15% according to himself... mhm

Thus I am still totally convinced that SI is >100%, and this data shows that there is no way it is what is being report by the likes of S3 or FINRA is accurate. What we are doing here, if not proving to you what the magical SI number definitely is, is showing that SI is *substantially* higher than what reports are claiming.

I am also certain GME has a significant issue with synthetic shares due to the volume of trading being a significant % of the total free float size of 50m (more like 24m in reality). AMC, a popular meme stock trades at 30% float, and most non meme popular stocks trade far, far, far lower than this in terms of volume / float.

Interestingly I did come across this - SI was at **132% on Feb 8th**, according to S&Pglobal (you know, the guys whos name is in the S&P500) in an article posted on Feb 18 - [https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/short-interest-in-us-stocks-declines-in-aftermath-of-gamestop-saga-data-shows-62699063](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/short-interest-in-us-stocks-declines-in-aftermath-of-gamestop-saga-data-shows-62699063). They later claimed on March 2nd that SI had dropped to 24% ""in mid february"" which makes absolutely no sense given price action - 132% to 24% as the stock hoves around $40. Ok then.

**Short Volume Today (Friday 12th): 5,793,090**

**SV%: 58.91%**

**His SI%$ range: 690.8% - 1038.8%**

**Daily Notes:** Oddly Slow day as fat call options expire as they were being boughten by the thousands minutes before market closed.  Extremely low Long volume, retail just holding. Off Market trades, bull instituations still carried us possible. Sizeable Shorts were place today.

**New notes for data:** It's getting to the point where Short Sellers would litterally need to be 80% of all off-market and long volume trades to be under 100%.

I changed the formula for the cost of OM volume to match the lowest price of the days as the off market is mainly Darkpool trades.

**New Conclusions** We can conclude that the % of volume used for covering is far less than their average of 30.75% since the 15th of january as a result of a big ol' FOMO rally from retail and a bull effort from institutions hogging up that volume  Therefore, it is not crazy to derive that ***SI% IS OVER 700%***, with a cost well over 5 billion $ to do so.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:** What I found was a tendency for these Short Sellers to get cocky and not cover on weeks when you would have expected them to. This means some weaks with low SV% had HUGE net gains in shorts. This never worked in reverse in the data.

**PROOF THAT FINRA DATA IS IMPOSSIBLE**  If you were to take the FINRA DATA from the 15th of january to the 24th of February, you would find that they would've needed to Cover using 30-32% of all transfers for the entire month and a half.

*Proof 1: It would have been impossible for them to comprise that portion of the covering with the FOMO wave and GAMMA squeeze that was hogging the data at the time.*  This 30-32% is notable. There was a considerable boost in daily volume in that period. So, you are talking about a MINIMAL COST OF **34.46 BILLION DOLLARS** using my formulas from my previous data. That being the bare minimum amount... just to lower it to the SI% they said it was at....

*Proof 2: We have not witnessed a loss of* ***22.65 Billion USD or more*** *from institutions in that time. That would have been a net loss btw, no bankruptcies were seen either*  I said above that I noticed that Short Sellers did not cover when the data suggested they had the opportunity. That this trend never reversed, a High weekly SV% yielded a net gain in short positions.

*Proof 3: SV% has remained over 50% throughout the 15th to 24th period, which provides evidence of a net gain in shorts... not a complete dip of the SI.*  Lastly, if all this was the way they say it did, then...

*Proof 4: The stock price would not have dropped during the period if they had covered. The data* ***HEAVILY*** *implies that shorts are used and held to stop upwards momentum*

&#x200B;

**His Reposnse to feedback:**

&#x200B;

>Short volume % of total volume can't reliably tell you how many new shorts have entered or covered that day because below:A market maker selling you a share that they haven't yet matched up with an actual seller but do a few seconds later will get counted as a short position momentarily. This apparently can and does happen and gets counted in the short volume. Meaning exactly no new short positions were taken but the short volume went up anyway. (I believe this is actually explained on FINRA's website -[https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019))  On the flip side, it does tell you the absolute highest number of short positions that could have been taken that day so new short positions could be anywhere between 0 and the high short volume amount, but due to the above as well as shorts entering and the covering in the same day means you can't really gleam anything from it reliably. Sorry

1: What you are describing would create a net neutral movement on the share price, which was not seen.

More importantly, the data I aquired clearly shows that there was a net gain of shorts when compared to the long volume (which is where they could have covered) day after day after day. It is possible, but the data says that they have been creating more shares than they can possibly cover even if they were 100% of the long volume everyday (which, as we know, is 90% algos and day traders)

I look at things from a scientific lens. All I aimed to do was to show that it is financially and numerically ***IMPOSSIBLE FOR SI% TO HAVE LOWERED SINCE THE 15TH OF JANUARY***.  It was the running assumption that everyone who believed in this had, and I provided damning evidence for it being the case.

&#x200B;

>This is not how it works Not saying that GME short interest is X or Y. But literally this is not how it works you really can’t use short volume to determine short interest.  INTERPRETING DAILY FINRA SHORT SALE REPORTS  Mods please don’t delete 📷 I’ve seen a lot of posts about FINRA daily short sale reports and what it means. Importantly it doesn’t mean what you think. This isn’t FUD it’s just how market making works.  TL;DR a lot of the short volume is market makers shorting to facilitate buy orders and they immediately cover with the next trade.  -High short volume in the FINRA report actually often reflects net BUYING. This is why trying to interpret these reports is pretty much useless.  -That sounds crazy but that’s how market making works. -FINRA report is only for off exchange trades (dark pools). It’s a myth that dark pools are all institutional, your retail broker is sending trades to dark pools like Citadel, Virtu, etc.***\[14:02\]***\-A MM makes money on the spread between buying and selling (obviously). What happens is - your order to buy 100 shares of GME at market gets sent to a dark pool. The MM (a computer) SHORTS you those shares at $108.793 and then BUYS those shares back at $108.791. A short of 100 shares is recorded. This also explains how you see ridiculous volumes and ridiculous # of shorts every day for a stock that has a 50M float. The MM isn’t “going short” GME. They short it for a millisecond then buy a fraction of a penny lower a millisecond later.  -So high short volume in the FINRA report (which is ONLY reflecting off exchange trades (dark pools) does NOT necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting. It often reflects high levels of buying! Um. Like we just saw this week. Repeat that It does also does NOT reflect exchange trades.  You don’t have to believe me you can read this super interesting piece here. Generally speaking, the idea that large short volume in the report is good news for holders seems true! It’s just not for the reasons you think.

&#x200B;

I didnt assume you were FUD, but it's a little sus when you open like that hahahahh  same as my answer for the last one, my data clearly shows that financially and data wise, there are more shorts being taken on most days, where the only way for them to even be below what they were on the 15th would be for them to litterally bankrupt themselves in the process.  What you describe there would have a net neutral effect on the share price. Share price plummetted as Short Volume exceeded long volume. That is the fact. The data disagrees with your rebuttal.

&#x200B;

>No, this post is misinformation. You cannot gauge short interest from short volume. Because a majority of short volume is closed in seconds. I keep telling people this. You should really make a wiki or sidebar notice about short volume. So much misinformation and misplaced hype because of short volume. High short volume does NOT mean high short interest.  To be clear, i believe short interest is super high for GME, but not due to short volume. There has been lots of legit DD done on this. But focusing on short volume is straight misinformation propagated by people who don't know what they're talking about.

&#x200B;

3. Same as the top two. Maybe try and actually take the time to read my the data I took hours transcribing and making palletable before waving it off and calling me ""Fake News"" K?   In conclusion: the data proves that SI% has gone up. The only argument Ive heard is the ""they cover instantly"" one which isnt whats shown in the data at all (its litterally the entire point of me showing Short Volume Overflow, to show how many more shorts there are compared to longs daily). If it were true, we'd have risen consistently as this theory would have 0 effect on the share price. What actually happened is they shorted it to 40$.

&#x200B;

In literally 10 minutes millions of shares became available for sale and hit every single bid-ask on the buy side. Sellers OVERWHELMED buyers and the price tanked $140.

Ask yourself for a moment why a holder of stock would ever want to get the least amount of money for it? If you wanted to sell stock you would sell it gradually so as to not 'spook' the market. You would want the price to remain strong while you un-wind your position.

There is only one explanation for what happened: a massively co-ordinated short interest attack to inspire fear and simulate a Bank Run (when the average investor loses confidence in the Church of GME and fears the price is in free fall).

They're trying to create a positive feed-back loop of fear where eventually YOU sell your shares.

This strategy of 'dumping' massive amounts of shares is, as everyone knows, VERY COMMON. It's why you see the after-market tank. It's why you see the pre-market tank. It's why you see an EARNINGS BEAT and then the shares DIVE OFF A CLIFF. It's shorts trying to inspire a panic.

What's very interesting about this short attack was that it was obviously massively coordinated. There are MANY shorts in GME and they are all acting, to some degree, independent based on their cost-basis and level of exposure. Some shorts may actually be switching their positions to go long.

[In my post here I explain why GME could be legitimately valued at $500 a share.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m35u61/memeageddon_judgement_day_witching_day_march_19th/)

This attack on March 10th reveals that there is a MASSIVE WHALE that is cornered and willing to dump billions to get out. It's absolute confirmation that someone does not want to have to buy-back shares at these prices.

If you are up against the wall, as a HF, and either lose billions or make billions, you are juts going to keep doubling down. The wall street motto is ""Greed is good"" and THEY WILL NOT GO QUITELY INTO THE NIGHT.

**Important price 5: $400**

At this point MOST buyers are in the money at a profit and you will start to see some profit taking. This may co-incide with a Short Attack to make it look like people are cashing in.

**Important price 6: $483 - THE ALL TIME HIGH**

As the all time high is approached many 'smart retards' will think to sell before other people start selling. Everyone is seeing that goal line and it may create more selling pressure as we reach that peak. There will also be less retail buying at these levels since who wants to buy at the peak. The only buyers will be the shorts covering which would just keep pushing the price up IF they get called and or are covering.

\*\*TLDR:\*\*There are at least 6 important price milestones at which shorts may attack next week and DUMP a lot of shares for sale in a short period of time. DO NOT PANIC... It's what they want.

[See my post on GME and other stocks from yesterday which was very successfully buried and received little attention.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m35u61/memeageddon_judgement_day_witching_day_march_19th/)

**Brokerages are starting to realize shorts are in BIG TROUBLE in $GME and $RKT.**

So far $RKT shorts have been in COMPLETE CONTROL of this stock and it's price since they IPOd at $18 in 2020.

In Feb 21 RKT BLASTED away earnings expectations and revenue with growth of 161%! Crazy amazing unexpected growth and profitability. The share price went from $19.90 to $21.85... LOL

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bwx447sfjtm61.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=e718f52e50d2819d41bc226f160d0f2d00562b8c

Since then

On March 1st and 2nd the shorts got side-lined by a bunch of WSB interest and the price spiked +71% to $43.

RKT CEO says their share price at $43 is OK but they are still not being fairly valued to peers. (youtube links not allowed)

So what do the shorts do? They DOUBLE DOWN as they always do!

They unload millions of new shorts to attack the price:

On March 4th they have dropped the price to $26.80.

**This chart shows the available short shares to borrow and the fee. On March 4th there are ONLY 100,000 shares available and a HUGE BORROWING FEE OF 59%**

Data from here: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT)

In the meantime paper-handed retail investors HAVE SOLD to this very obvious GME tactic once again and there are now more shorts available! These guys are so good at doubling down.

[Market Watch calls Short Interest at 40% on Feb 26th. Since the price went up and they just shorted millions more shares you can bet your sweet bananas short interest is probably higher.](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/rkt)

From a technical analysis POV the chart has 3 trailing support lines. In other words the price is very unlikely to dip below $23.50. Your downside is very minimal.

&#x200B;

The morning of March 12th RKT was UP in pre-market. When the market opened there was huge volume and price drove down, killed the momentum and people thought they lost.

During that same time MILLIONS of shorts were fired:

Shares available went from 5.6M to 1.9M. Then retail SOLD.... You weak apes.

The OPEN INTEREST for MARCH 19th OUT THE MONEY IS INSANE.

&#x200B;

Check out the strike of $30 with 48,889 contracts. On a float of only 100,000,000 (a little bigger than gme) that represents 4,888,900 shares just there (usually MMs will buy 50% or so as it approaches ITM).

In other words if this gets to $29 it will just keep going up until the highest strike - So above $65 likely.

**That's about a 300% return from current price.**

Also remember we have the DTCC new rule coming soon, we don't know the date yet but that's making the shorts piss their pants as they would have less liquidity to fight with. They really want to shake out all the retail money at the cheapest price THIS WEEK.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

RKT is one of the most manipulated prices since IPO. Despite amazing performance, surprise earnings, dividends and buyback announcements the stock has been held under $24.

The stock is starting to be put on short-selling restricted lists which means shorts are over-risked and brokerages know this.

RKT has a relatively small float with high short interest. It won't take a lot to light the match. The options interest for next week also allows for a big gamma squeeze if the price hits $29 for a sustained period. We're at $25... It's not a lot to ask for.

I couldn't find any thread discussing this but I believe this is a topic that can't be overlooked as it surely explains why many of us are bonding and showing similar behaviours in this GME / AMC saga. Plus, it may also explain why this is probably one of our greatest strength.I'm myself diagnosed Asperger myself and have spent years researching on the matter as I needed to understand why I couldn't feel and think the way my friends would. I'm sure I'm not the only one here.

SO...

# What is Autism and what is its prevalance in humans?

&#x200B;

**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\- Autism is a [developmental disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disorder) characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-DSM5-3)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism)

\- ASD manifest in different forms and degrees. It can be low, mild, severe and isn't always manifesting as a severe mental disability.[https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/autism-spectrum-disorders](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/autism-spectrum-disorders)*eg:* [*Asperger's syndrome*](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/mental-health-aspergers-syndrome) *is on the milder end of the* [*autism*](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/default.htm) \*spectrum. A person with Asperger's may be very intelligent and able to handle their daily life. They may be really focused on topics that interest them and discuss them nonstop. But they have a much harder time socially.

&#x200B;

**Prevalence**

\- About 1 percent of the world population has autism spectrum disorder. ([CDC, 2014](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html))

\- Prevalence in the United States is estimated at 1 in 54 births. ([CDC, 2020](https://www.autism-society.org/releases/cdc-releases-new-prevalence-rates-of-people-with-autism-spectrum-disorder/))

\- More than 3.5 million Americans live with an autism spectrum disorder. ([Buescher et al., 2014](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-09/autism-costs-more-than-2-million-over-patient-s-life.html))

\- Prevalence of autism in U.S. children increased by 119.4 percent from 2000 (1 in 150) to 2010 (1 in 68). ([CDC, 2014](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html)) Autism is the fastest-growing developmental disability. ([CDC, 2020](https://www.autism-society.org/releases/cdc-releases-new-prevalence-rates-of-people-with-autism-spectrum-disorder/))

\- Prevalence has increased by 6-15 percent each year from 2002 to 2010. (Based on biennial numbers from the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html))

\-  25% of 4500 children showing ASD symptoms participating in a study were not diagnosed and didn't know know they're affected. [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aur.2255](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aur.2255)

\-  ASD can be seen on brain MRIs, ASD brains physically developed differently.  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081653/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081653/)

# ""Ok that's a lot but not all of us here have ASD... Even if one 1/54 or 1% of us on here did, how could this be proven and mean anything anyway?""

Well, the pourcentage of ASD apes on here is likely to be **higher** than in those studies... Why?

**Social Media Use and Happiness in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder**\*""Social Media use by adults with ASD, specifically Facebook use in moderation, may enhance well-being and may be a protective factor against secondary mental health concerns common in this population"".In a 2013 study\*[*,*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563213000708) *researcher* ***Micah O. Mazurek*** ***found that the majority of adults with autism use social media to meet friends.***[^(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)

**Social media use among adults with autism spectrum disorders***The purpose of this study was to examine patterns and social–emotional correlates of social media use in adults with ASD. Participants completed self-report measures of social media use, friendship quality and quantity, and loneliness.* ***The results indicated that the majority of participants (79.6%) used social networking sites (SNS)****, and that the most commonly cited reason for using SNS was social connection. Adults with ASD who used SNS were more likely to have close friends, and those who used SNS for social engagement reported closer friendship relationships.*

**Social Media help autistic children navigate the world***Dr. Szatmari: the human face doesn't have the same drawing power for an autistic child, and that something about technology triggers the motivation that's lacking in face-to-face contact.* ***This can really have a big impact in helping people with ASD navigate the world and be able to do things that we never thought possible before.***[^(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/social-media-helping-autistic-children-navigate-the-world/article4358736/)](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/social-media-helping-autistic-children-navigate-the-world/article4358736/)

**Yale study: 'Social media boosts friendship quality in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder'**[^(https://medicine.yale.edu/childstudy/news-article/15234/)](https://medicine.yale.edu/childstudy/news-article/15234/)

If you do some research, you will see that there's many other studies explaining why social medias are one of ASD favorite way to connect and communicate.

Maybe it would be interesting do a pol to see who's diagnosed or feel like being misdiagnosed here...

# ""Yeh ok but what's the link with GME or the stock market then?""

That's where things get interesting...There are hundreds of studies out there showing that **reward pathways** of autistic people are altered and therefore their social relationships but also their **relationship with money** is totally different than the TD brains.

**Reward Circuitry Function in Autism During Face Anticipation and Outcomes***The aim of this study was to investigate reward circuitry responses in autism during reward anticipation and outcomes for monetary and social rewards.* ***During monetary anticipation, participants with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) showed hypoactivation in right nucleus accumbens and hyperactivation in right hippocampus, whereas during monetary outcomes, participants with ASDs showed hyperactivation in left midfrontal and anterior cingulate gyrus.*** *Groups did not differ in nucleus accumbens responses to faces. The ASD group demonstrated hyperactivation in bilateral amygdala during face anticipation that predicted social symptom severity and in bilateral insular cortex during face outcomes.* ***These results add to the growing body of evidence that autism is characterized by altered functioning of reward circuitry.*** *Additionally, atypical amygdala activation during the processing of social rewards may contribute to the development or expression of autistic features.*[^(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-011-1221-1)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-011-1221-1)

**Risk-Aversion and Rationality in Autism Spectrum Disorders***Risk-aversion and rationality have both been highlighted as core features of decision making in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). This study tested whether risk-aversion is related to rational decision-making in ASD individuals. ASD and matched control adults completed a decision-making task that discriminated between the use of risk-averse and rational strategies. Results showed that overall, ASD participants were more risk-averse than control participants. Specifically, both groups made similar choices when risk-aversion was the less rational strategy but* ***ASD participants chose more rational options than control participants when risk-aversion was the most rational strategy. This study confirmed that risk-aversion is a core feature of ASD and revealed that ASD individuals can switch their decision-making strategy adaptively to avoid negative consequences.***[^(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-018-3616-8)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-018-3616-8)

**Reward system dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders**\*“Participants with ASD showed the expected hypoactivation in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry in response to both reward types. In particular, diminished activation in the nucleus accumbens was observed when money, but not when social reward, was at stake, whereas the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex were hypoactivated within the ASD group in response to both rewards.\* ***These data indicate that the reward circuitry is compromised in ASD in social as well as in non-social, i.e. monetary conditions,*** ***which likely contributes to atypical motivated behaviour.”***[^(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682440/)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682440/)

# ""Cool but it says ASD individuals can switch their decision-making strategy adaptively to avoid negative consequences... so it could also mean you could paperhand?""

Well, not exactly...

**Emotional decision-making in autism spectrum disorder: the roles of interoception and alexithymia.** [^(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5062918/)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5062918/)""*These results demonstrate that although framing effects are associated with interoception and alexithymia in the neurotypical population,* ***emotional and interoceptive signals have less impact upon the decision-making process in ASD***\*.""\*

**Trait Autism is a Better Predictor of Empathy than Alexithymia***The study found that having more autistic traits is associated with lower empathy – even after factoring alexithymia into the analysis. In fact, the study provides some of the* \*\*\*best evidence so far that autism is definitely linked to lower empathy.\*\*\***Autism and Reactions to Provocation in a Social and Non-social Context**[^(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-019-04257-w)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-019-04257-w)*Compared to Healthy controles, individuals with ASD showed similar externalizing behavior in the social context.* ***In the non-social context*** *(meaning non physical environment)* ***reactions after provocation were enhanced relative to non-provoking situations.*** *The findings implicate that the context is an important influencing variable when comparing individuals with ASD to HCs after being provoked.*

See where I'm going?

# ""Ok but it still doesn't mean you wouldn't give up at some point?""

ASD mostly characterised by Restrictive and Repetitive behaviours. We get even more obsessed when it comes to things we enjoy and distract us... or rather keep us in focus.

And what do ASD love more than everything? Yes Cramer, that's exactly what we like, the stock... because we love video games!

**The risk for pathological video game use appears larger in adults with ASD compared with TD ('traditional') adults**[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)

**Video game use in boys with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, or typical development***Boys with ASD spend much more time playing video games than do boys with TD, and boys with ASD and ADHD are at greater risk for problematic video game use than are boys with TD.*[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23897915/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23897915/)

**Video games from the perspective of adults with autism spectrum disorder**The most frequent all-time favorite video game genres were Role-Playing (31%) and Action-Adventure (19%).  *To the moon, right?*[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563215003581](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563215003581)

**Restricted and repetitive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders**[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21574682/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21574682/)

# ""Mmmmmh... but if all of this is just a game to you, you'll still end up turning off the console when you'll realise you might not get what you want?""

Nope, not really... the funny thing about ASD RRBs is that we are excited by the reward anticipation itself, not the reward. As long as the adversaire isn't down its knees giving up, we won't turn off the console. Plus, the thing we'll miss the most and regret while being millionaires is the entertainment and excitement itself.

**Common alterations in sensitivity to type but not amount of reward in ADHD and autism spectrum disorders**\*'The results, while not supporting hyposensitivity to changes in reward amount in ADHD and ASD, do suggest that both groups are generally less motivated in settings where social as opposed to monetary rewards can be earned.'\*[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223259/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223259/)

**Money motivates in autism, attention deficit**'*They also perform better when the reward is greater: for example, 15 cents rather than 5, or comments such as “You’re a star” as opposed to “Well done.”'*[https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/cognition-and-behavior-money-motivates-in-autism-attention-deficit/](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/cognition-and-behavior-money-motivates-in-autism-attention-deficit/)

**Autistic Traits Affect Reward Anticipation but not Reception**[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65345-x](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65345-x)

I've lost a link to an amazing study showing that ASD individuals were more generous when it came to sharing their monetary reward with other participants compared to control. If anyone finds it, please post it in the comments :).

# Conclusion

Hedgies can try manipulate the ASD apes we are with FUD or any other techniques; ASD brains won’t react. We don't show improvement with hours of therapy not using reward as stimuli. And our stimuli here... well they are trying to take it away from us so all it does is increasing our obsession and make us buy more.

https://preview.redd.it/70mfnfqlatm61.jpg?width=560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5704ffb1f90a538c2f0e91accd0844c72856615

Anyway, I have no idea if all I just put together makes sense or is accurate but as having ASD, I'm relating to all of these facts 100%.

I also understand that there might just be only 10 of us with ASD here, as well as there could be 100k  but if you are not ASD and call yourself autist, make us proud with your diamond hands!

There's one thing I'm sure tho, it is that I love you all beautiful apes.

See you on the moon with unlimited crayons and video games.

\-  well you know what

i  know it's maybe a bit ""apples n oranges"" ; but let's take a quick look at DASH shall we...?

Now  if DASH can take on most of delivery business in US  (including  business w no or in-house delivery services start outsourcing to DASH  and of  course they can start collecting/mining info get into  advertising etc etc ) -  then yes - i say DASH might be worth 46B maybe  even much more (btw - DASH currently is doing less in Sales and looses  as much as GME)

Market  is forward  looking so considering GME and it's potential in - gaming;  e-sports;  betting; e-sports tournaments/events and the fact that the  brand name  is getting a positive FREE SYMPATHETIC PUBLICITY around the  world  especially among GME core users and considering demographic -  who's  then to say that GME is not actually worth the current SP of \~$300  and  why should it be valued 3 times LESS than DASH???!!!

Also I ran a quick ""back of the envelope"" screener (all data are from [Finviz.com](https://finviz.com/) link below // );

I  only specified few fundamental and technical parameters to try to see  what I come up with - take a look-see; snoop around a bit; click away on  some of the familiar names... and some of those business are app's (of  course i'm over-simplifying!!! don't get on my case - I'm VENTING!!!)

There  are currently more than 20 Co's (some of which might be hailed as  disruptions, innovators and all around trailblazers) who's MC is larger  than GME's - in some cases considerably larger; most if not ALL (i have  not checked one by one) are loosing some big bucks - in the billions;  some have triple digits F/PE; ROI/ROA/ROE in deep double digit red - but  hey you don't see a band of apes getting assigned the responsibility of  unreasonably and blatantly ""manipulating"" and  inflating the SP and  keeping the MC where it's at..... (btw reason DASH didn't make the list  is coz they currently don't have ROI/ROA listed)

So in conclusion: **TLDR**

GME SP is currently in ""no-man's"" land and ""Who's to say GME is over-valued....??!!"" - (fundamentally, of course, we all understand it is currently, but again, markets are forward looking, GME has A LOT going for it now and is taking active and tangible steps to adopts and fine tune it's business model and is no more ""over-valued"" than some of the market ""darlings"" currently trading at considerable premium)

To  the moons!!! (yeah you got that right - MOONS - plural - i am maybe a  retard ape but i know MARS has two moons, M  A  R  S - Mars biches...  and don't get me started w Jupiter and Saturn - take that suits...!!!!)

**Swing Trades (6 Month Plays)**

* **Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT; -13%)**: Sarepta is **massively undervalued**. **Only player right now in the DMD space**. Additional **FDA approvals** suggest that the FDA is still keen on SRPT's treatments (there was a little controversy in the past). Trade carefully though, this stock can get volatile. I believe that I got in a little too early, but my personal **PT for SRPT is 120**.
* **Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG; +22%)**: 3 main reasons why GNOG is a strong buy. Firstly, it is a **severely undervalued** stock. Warrants have also mostly expired / been exercised. Secondly, **online gambling is getting legalized** across the US. Thirdly, the **brand recognition** in the US is pretty high. If Draft Kings is the global player for millennials, **GNOG is the US player for boomers**. Would love to write an in-depth analysis on GNOG when I have time. 
* **General Dynamics (GD; +12%)**: **Space baby, space**. Increased government contracts + retail interest = Boom.
* Helca Mining (HL; +6%): Super volatile trade. Indirect hedge against inflation. 
* Lockheed Martin (LMT; +1%): Severely undervalued IMO. Also, Space. 

**Buy and Hold (Long Term Plays)**

* Ozon Holdings (OZON; +19%): Amazon of Russia. Highly volatile though, so I'd recommend caution on when and at what price you enter this trade. 
* Royal Dutch Shell (RDSB; +14%): Great management team + execution = Likely successful in transition into clean energy. 
* British Petroleum (BP; +4%): Fastest transition by a major oil player into clean energy. 2nd time's the charm, I believe. 
* Dollar General (DGBP; -3%): The underlying economy is actually quite week IMO. There's likely to have been quite a bit of capital scrapping over the past year. Unemployment has fallen and people are getting vaccinated. But there is a non-zero risk of another potential wave (SA Variant) which may result in an increase in U3. U6 unemployment is also likely to be above typical averages after COVID as employers realize many of their employees can plausibly be streamlined.

FSLR got caught up with short selling around the same time as GME so it is looking like some tasty dip right now, let me tell you why.

THESE FUCKING GENIUSES DON'T USE SILICON

Did you know that 80% of solar production relies on the same dumb shit as GPUs and smart cars? 

You know graphics cards cost twice as much and are impossible to buy. Extrapolate that into the summer when everyone but Texas wants to cash in on this green new deal jam. Retail/Scalpers may benefit from that, but it's less than worthless when you are filling last year's wholesale orders. 

The cost of metallurgical silicon is up 30%. Every DD done since 2010 basically ignores the possibility that we could have another shortage. Thanks pandemic. Now they are saying 5 years to sort it out entirely? That's Biden's entire administration.

Oh, and did you know that nearly every solar company with meaningful output is not 'really' based in the US. There are three diamond domestic dogs: FSLR, TSLA, and SPWR.

Did you know that 80% of solar production relies on the same dumb shit as GPUs and smart cars? 

You know graphics cards cost twice as much and are impossible to buy. Extrapolate that into the summer when everyone but Texas wants to cash in on this green new deal jam. Retail/Scalpers may benefit from that, but it's less than worthless when you are filling last year's wholesale orders. 

The cost of metallurgical silicon is up 30%. Every DD done since 2010 basically ignores the possibility that we could have another shortage. Thanks pandemic. Now they are saying 5 years to sort it out entirely? That's Biden's entire administration.

**Options are the easiest way to lose money. If  you are going to walk into this pit of snakes; do not start off by doing it dick first. I am not a professional. This is not financial advice. If I am wrong call me out. If I don't know the answer to a question I will find someone that does.**

Now you have a choice, some would say the option, to read this wall of text which means you  think, ask questions, get Gud or you not and you can Yolo Gamble at the moon and be angry/happy that the stonk god that lives in your phone givith or taketh away...

**So lets touch the monolith shall we**[**.**](https://u.teknik.io/kJXMd.jfif)

These services let you trade what's called covered options. You can buy puts and calls.  Let's talk about the long call to start once you figure that out you can just reverse everything and call it a put.

**Long calls are types of options** which are a contract that is made between you and the seller of the contract that states you have the right to purchase shares of the underlying stock for the price agreed upon from that seller.  This is called the strike price, but it's really just the price that you can purchase the stock at. So You now own the right not the obligation to purchase the stock at anytime between now and when the option closes. Some would say you have the OPTION to purchase the stock at the agreed upon price not the obligation. Option contracts are actually a bundle of contracts covering 100 shares.

So the seller is betting that by the date the the share price will be ""out of the money"" or beneath the contract strike price and you are betting it will be above it. Because if you buy the right to purchase GOEV at 15 dollars for 100 shares and it's 30 dollars by the time the contract is up you now own 15$ x 100 in value. Because you can take the 100 shares you got for 15 and sell them for 30. What if you paid just a fraction for the right to do this?  What if you paid say. 10 cents per share for the right to do this... You might make some money..  This is why options are called derivative products because they derive the value from what they contain not from the actual share of the company. Options contain the time left until expiry.  In this time they may go up or down.  The ability for an option to gain more value (and lose it) directly affects the price of the option.  Options that are farther out are less risky for you and more risky for the seller so will always be more expensive than ones closer in.

The price per contract represents money times 100 shares because it is the price per share so a 5 cent 3/19 15c (A long call for 15 dollars representing the ability to purchase 100 shares of the underlying stock for 15 dollars a share at any time until 3/19 costing 5 cents per share) is 5 bucks a contract... 0.05 cents per share x 100 shares = 1 call option contract.


If the Share Price at the time of expiry is 14.99 the option is worthless because you could just go to market and buy it there cheaper it just wouldn't make sense to ""execute"" the option on 99 percent of the situations. A short squeeze is actually one of the situations where executing makes sense for shorts underwater.

So if I was going to sell you the right to buy $GOEV at 100 bucks, that's a lot of risk for you and not a lot of risk for me so the price would be low... 0.05 cents per contract x100 contracts per bundle would be 5 bucks.  So you with 50 bucks could have 10 contracts... I take your 50 bucks and think I made a good trade...

Tomorrow UBER says they partnered. (A very real possibility) and it revalues the company at 75 billion dollars or so which is 20x it's current share price of like 200 and now you have the right to buy 10 bundles of 100 shares at 100 dollars per share  and you could immediately sell that on the market for profit. So you spent 50 bucks but in the end will make (1,000 x 100 dollars) so 100,000 dollars from 50.  **But people will buy that right from you for that much so you don't have to actually purchase the shares.**  so the price of that contract would be 100 (with a little sugar on top for how much time is left on it) x100 per contract. Now what if the expiry of this contract was tomorrow. Is it very likely that the valuation of $GOEV will be 100 tomorrow? No so that would be dumb to even buy for any money. but what about in 2 years. Well that's way more likely and so the price will change based upon the likelihood of the sp achieving these prices..

Lets say you spend 1000 dollars on a fuck ton of options for a strike price of 3 dollars on a stock that's worth 2. You pay .40  for them.  If that stock goes to 1.50. It is very likely that the price will go to .20  meaning you just lost 500 fucking dollars. Just like that.  Whereas you would only have lost 250 if you bought shares. Options also expire and Shares last foreverish. Options are timed play most of the time as in you think there is going to be a catalyst which moves the Share price.

Also, Open Interest means the amount of contracts out for a given strike price.  Sometimes there isn't enough volume to support that mega bag of super OTM option contracts you got on some weird stock no one knows about.  Make sure there is plenty of volume if its something you are going to move.

So you wanna buy options when the stock is down and sell them when it's up because you get your max benefits like shares. In fact you want to time options so that you time market sentiment or news.  Feel like a buyout is coming and it might affect the SP positively.. well yolo some calls brosky.  **Remember TA is virgin astrology. DD is the Lifestyle Chads live.**

Also, you will always put a limit price on your purchase or sales for these options.  A limit is just declaring you will sell these options for said price.  You can not just ""market buy"" options for as far as I know.

You will never owe money on Robinhood because you can only buy or sell calls or puts that are covered. Covered means you set the shares aside 100 of them until expiry.. naked means you have enough big baller money to say hey.. I'm good for it... Naked options are where the theoretically infinite loss comes from due to the fact that the share price could change infinitely... As in what if you needed 100 shares and there's only 101 and I knew you needed them so I could charge you whatever money I wanted... This is where naked shorting gets I to a problem...  Those calls you bought? Someone else is covering them or more likely a market maker worth billions is good for them. Robinhood wouldn't let you be that dumb...

The last piece here is that market makers have to maintain a certain amount of shares on hand per every option they sell.. this is related to the Delta which is the change in price over time... So a Delta of .5 means that for every 100 shares a market maker has to own 50 if the price goes over the strike price or itm at expiry a market maker has to have 100 shares per 1 contract sold. So it goes and just buys it at market.  There are a metric fuckton of calls that are sold on GOEV that are approaching being in the money and when they do mm have to buy which drives up the price... I  actually suspect a bunch of gambling addicted apes are jacking those numbers to Mars.  Making MM purchase millions of shares per every dollar of valuation.

For example there are currently 26523 contracts for 3/29 17.5c 26523 x100 means those contracts represent 2.6 million shares.  When the SP hits 16 and it becomes more likely that it will be in the money market makers will go to market and purchase 265k shares and that's just for that one strike price for 1 dollar.. AKA the beating heart of the Gamma Squeeze.

The price of an option contract is called the premium you can see how ~~share price had to go above the Strike~~ if the market **believes** the share price will go above the strike price and the premium you paid you will profit.  As the share price approaches the strike price and the velocity increases, raising the premium means the next buyer will take on the option at a higher price.  You get laid because you took the risk initially and are essentially creating a safer bet for the next person.  Or so they think. 

Essentially you bought tickets to the moon while the rocketship was on the launch pad and then it took off without exploding. Mid flight those tickets would be more expensive because there's more of a likelihood of getting there. But still some risk.

Also, you will always put a limit price on your purchase or sales for these options.  A limit is just declaring you will sell these options for said price.  You can not just ""market buy"" options for as far as I know.

You will never owe money on Robinhood because you can only buy or sell calls or puts that are covered. Covered means you set the shares aside 100 of them until expiry.. naked means you have enough big baller money to say hey.. I'm good for it... Naked options are where the theoretically infinite loss comes from due to the fact that the share price could change infinitely... As in what if you needed 100 shares and there's only 101 and I knew you needed them so I could charge you whatever money I wanted... This is where naked shorting gets I to a problem...  Those calls you bought? Someone else is covering them or more likely a market maker worth billions is good for them. Robinhood wouldn't let you be that dumb...

The last piece here is that market makers have to maintain a certain amount of shares on hand per every option they sell.. this is related to the Delta which is the change in price over time... So a Delta of .5 means that for every 100 shares a market maker has to own 50 if the price goes over the strike price or itm at expiry a market maker has to have 100 shares per 1 contract sold. So it goes and just buys it at market.  There are a metric fuckton of calls that are sold on GOEV that are approaching being in the money and when they do mm have to buy which drives up the price... I  actually suspect a bunch of gambling addicted apes are jacking those numbers to Mars.  Making MM purchase millions of shares per every dollar of valuation.

For example there are currently 26523 contracts for 3/29 17.5c 26523 x100 means those contracts represent 2.6 million shares.  When the SP hits 16 and it becomes more likely that it will be in the money market makers will go to market and purchase 265k shares and that's just for that one strike price for 1 dollar.. AKA the beating heart of the Gamma Squeeze.

**This is the real game you are playing and how you fit into it my friends...**

Option value is just a description of a point in the trajectory of a rocket ship, should it actually take off this helps you figure out the optimal height to bail.

Edit 2 - [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m41ghq/options_101_for_the_learned_ape_knuckles_off_the/gqt2a2s?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) is a good question by /u/UncoolDad31. The price of an option contract is called the premium you can see how ~~share price had to go above the Strike~~ if the market **believes** the share price will go above the strike price and the premium you paid you will profit.  As the share price approaches the strike price and the velocity increases, raising the premium means the next buyer will take on the option at a higher price.  You get laid because you took the risk initially and are essentially creating a safer bet for the next person.  Or so they think. 

Essentially you bought tickets to the moon while the rocketship was on the launch pad and then it took off without exploding. Mid flight those tickets would be more expensive because there's more of a likelihood of getting there. But still some risk. By the time you reach the moon those tickets would reflect the least risk because you're already there. But maybe you haven't totally landed.  The best time to sell options  is on a spike right before the rocket explodes.

**TDLR**:  CEO of UWMC, who won Bball national championship with Michigan State,  went to war with RKT. RKT responded by buying naming rights for Michigan  State BB team. New name ""Michigan State Spartans presented by Rocket  mortgage....

Alright so I have  been a long time holder of RKT and have played with UWMC. With Billions  being delayed I have more free time to watch real life.

**Step 1:** Mat Plays for Michigan State.

So  Mat was a walk on that made the team. Not that  there is anything wrong with that. He put in his dues, practiced against future NBA stars, and got himself a National Championship ring! So that is  sweet who does not want one of those. Mat is a loyal alumi and donates  lots of money. Link to his Forbes article on running his company like  Michigan st BBall [https://www.forbes.com/sites/robdube/2019/05/27/what-playing-for-a-national-championship-winning-basketball-team-taught-this-ceo-about-leadership/?sh=2b26e2107c91](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robdube/2019/05/27/what-playing-for-a-national-championship-winning-basketball-team-taught-this-ceo-about-leadership/?sh=2b26e2107c91)

**Step 2:** Dan Gilbert also goes to Michigan State....

So Dan Gilbert founder of Rocket companies also went to Michigan State. He is also a loyal alumnis.

**Step 3. Gauntlet is tossed down.**

Mat  hops on facebook live (looking high as hell... good for him) and tells  all his clients ""it us or them... ARE YOU ALL IN"" and has his clients  sign a contract that they will not deal with RKT. (None of my links will  post)

**Step 4.**  Buy the thing your enemy loves. (Art of War chapter 97)

Dan  Gilbert decides to throw his money bags around. After all what good is  having ""Fuck You Money"" if you dont use it. So what does he do. He goes  and buys the naming rights for Michigan St basketball team. So now every  time Mat looks at the thing he loves, the team he won a championship  with. It says "" Spartans presented by **Rocket Mortgage""**

Edit!!!! - Apparently they will not be fully named. https://www.freep.com/story/sports/college/michigan-state/spartans/2021/03/12/michigan-state-basketball-rocket-mortgage-sponsorship/4665634001/

“The sponsorship adds to a donation war between two of the nation’s leading lenders. Mat Ishbia, a former MSU basketball player who is the CEO of United Wholesale Mortgage, donated $32 million in February to the athletic department.

1615598608.0,INTU,"Last month I wrote a post on why I'm buying $HRB leaps ([Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llok83/hrb_hr_block_buy_some_leaps_and_forget_about_em/)). My main reasons were: 

1. Pivot from brick & mortar to digital which could lead to higher sales multiples
2. Their $3.5b stock buyback program which still has $600m to go and will run through June 2022 (for reference: their current market cap is $3.84b)

Today, H&R Block announced 4 new Vice Presidents that will help drive the next phase of growth for the company. Among them are:

Karisa Booker, who previously led a complete consumer data transformation of AMC's marketing

Scott Runkel, who was head of product at Walmart and led the team responsible for ""defining quality standards for digital products."" 

These appointments reaffirm H&R Block's commitment to a digital transformation.

In addition to pivoting to digital, I believe that HRB's new focus on small businesses will greatly improve its bottom line. Some of you might wonder, there over 200 million tax paying individuals in the USA but merely 30 million small businesses, why should they focus on small businesses?

I think the answer is quite simple: most **individuals only file their taxes once a year,** and there are plenty of free do-it-yourself options for them. On the other hand, **businesses pay taxes year-round.** Payroll, sales tax, income tax, bookkeeping, many of which will require services that could generate more revenue compared to individuals doing their income tax one time a year.

HRB is expected to bring in $3.55b of revenue in 2021. Currently, it has a PS ratio of **1.42**, compared to their competitor Intuit (TurboTax)'s **13.65**. Intuit Inc ($INTU) trades at $395 with a market cap of over $108b. There's no doubt in my mind that the upside will be tremendous if HRB can successfully pull off the transformation. 

HRB released earnings on March 8th and reported a -$1.17 EPS for the quarter, beating the consensus estimate of -$1.29. The call transcript can be found [here](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/03/09/hr-block-hrb-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcript/).

Fun Fact: HRB's CEO Jeff Jones was briefly the President of UBER in 2017 but quit during the #DeleteUber movement which took aim at the company's gender bias and toxic culture in the workplace. Jeff cited ""differences over beliefs and approach to leadership"" as his reason for resigning. Four years later, under Jeff's leadership, HRB scored 100% on the Corporate Equality Index and is recognized as one of ""Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality.""

1615598198.0,QFIN,"EDIT3: **WOOOOOOOOO .  Not only did earnings beat, but they straightup said that regulations will not negatively impact them and, in some cases, will actually help them.  The anti-trust regs against tencent's fintech will open up more room for growth for QFIN.**

“ On the regulatory front, we believe that the regulations brought out recently either has minimal impact to our business, or in some cases, even created favorable environment for top platforms like us. As you may already know, the new ruling from the Supreme People’s Court removed the more restrictive lending rate cap for our business. The new guideline on drug lending and micro-lending has a minimal impact on our business as our exposure to both is quite marginal. On the other hand, China’s antitrust and deleveraging push may squeeze some market share away from the industry giants, which will bring us spill over market opportunities” -CEO

This call and the earnings are even better than I was hoping.  Now we just need the market to realize it!  See you all on the moon.

EDIT2: Stock dropped today (3/15) alongside the entire sector.  It isn't dropping on its own - all the chinese fintechs, including the ones that are exposed to microlending, are dropping today.  Good last minute chance to buy, especially since premarket it was actually up 7% haha.  If you're really worried about macroeconomic risk, a good play might be to buy a ITM PUT on a fintech that's exposed, and an ITM call on QFIN. A hedge, so to speak.  But personally i'm not doing that. This is a casino, after all. 
____________
**EDIT: Many people have brought up concern that this stock has already tripled and might be played out. I strongly disagree - from a valuation standpoint it is still an amazing buy. It wasn’t the cash flow or loan quality keeping the price down - it was the regulatory risk. As that risk diminishes it will grow to reach it’s fair valuation, which is around 50 using even a conservative growth rate in a conservative FCFE. The real risk is new regulations, or a bigger impact of the current ones, hence why I spent most of this DD talking about them. Right now the market is pricing in regulations wiping out about half of their revenue sources, which I strongly disagree with.

The earnings call is Monday at 9PM EST, which is Tuesday morning for QFIN in China. The numbers will be interesting but the real catalyst will be management’s discussion of the impact of regulations. Make sure to place all bets by then!**
______________

I have ventured out of my usual territory in my hunt for an exotic rocket ship-shaped banana, and I’ve got good news for all ape-kind: I’ve found one. Here’s my DD (whatever that means). 

Ticker: **QFIN**, AKA ""360 Digitech"". They are a Chinese Fintech company. Currently trading around $31.50. Market Cap is around 4.8 Billion. Very few people in America have heard of them. PE is less than 10, growth is insane, plenty of cash on the balance sheet, low leverage, etc. From a fundamentals or cashflow analysis, this is a banana mine. 

**Here's their business model:**

*First*, they use their online presence to advertise loans to the rapidly-growing Chinese middle class.

*Second*, they use their proprietary risk-assessment tools to analyze the credit-worthiness of the applicants. They also have proprietary identification tools to help prevent fraud and simultaneously speed up the loan process (this is a bigger deal than it sounds like due to the strong desire for convenience in lending) 

*Third*, they partner with banks to supply the capital for the loans. 

*Fourth,* they service the loans and deal with recovery in case of defaults.

The business model is important because in order to understand why this is an amazing buy you also need to understand where their revenue comes from. It's not just loan interest as you would expect.

**But first, let’s talk numbers.** 
*(In RMB, 1 USD = 6.5 RMB / CNY)
2017 Revenue: *175 million* 
2018 Revenue: *3.75 Billion* 
2019 Revenue: *6.99 Billion* 
TTM: *9.19 Billion* (TTM means trailing twelve months, this is 4Q2019 to 3Q2020)

Obviously that’s insane growth. Most apes can’t even count that high. 

And yet, despite that growth, their P/E ratio is a measly **9.4!** *(P/E is a measure of how high up tree us apes must climb to reach banana, lower number = banana more soon)* **That’s less than half the P/E of the S&P 500** *(P/E: 27.5*), **despite having significantly more growth.** 

To understand why the stock is still so cheap, let’s talk about why dumb apes might *NOT* want to buy it. 

Firstly, I assume most of you haven’t bought it yet because you have never heard of it. Do a search for QFIN on reddit – it’s next to impossible to find mention of it here. Furthermore, the trading volume is extremely low…. And most of the ownership is institutional. A few hedge funds, sure, but mostly ETFs, which is exactly what’s caused this great buying opportunity. As most Chinese Fintech stock prices have struggled lately with regulations (with the exception of this week), QFIN is relatively immune from the changes. QFIN has only gone down because most of the ownership is through the sector ETFs, which have been dragging QFIN down with them. Only recently did it buck the trend and move away from its sector's performance, in large part because people are just now starting to notice it.

This is a misunderstood company with obvious value. The play here isn’t that there’s extra value - the value is obvious to everyone - the play is that the “problems” are being significantly exaggerated and misunderstood… so rather than tell you where the deep value is, I will instead focus on why the doubters are wrong and why QFIN is uniquely placed in its sector. 

**First Reason for Doubt – Winnie the Pooh.** The Chinese Fintech industry has recently been slapped with some extra regulations that I had to get my mandarin-speaking wife to translate for me. 

One regulation is that for microlending transactions involving banks and partners, the partners (in this case, QFIN) must contribute at least 25% of the capital. Here’s a breakdown of the rules: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown). *The stock tanked 30% when this happened.*

**Why it doesn’t matter:** According to QFIN’s CEO, Wu “Cock Slapper” Haisheng, *“Currently, the outstanding balance of the outstanding loans issued through our micro lending subsidiary, accounts for less than 1% of the total loan balance, and joint lending accounts for around 0.01%. Therefore, based on our personal evaluation, the new rules will have little impact on our loan origination business.”* 

Another new regulation is that online lending can only be done with banks that are established in the same province as the applicant. This is no problem – QFIN has a multitude of partners in each region. There are other new regulations coming down the pipeline (capital requirements, etc) but QFIN is well capitalized and capable of overcoming all the known issues. 

**Second Reason for Doubt – Default Risk.** There is concern that the loan default rate will be high, especially if China’s economy crashes, and that this will destroy the value of the company similarly to what happened to US banks with bad mortgages in 2008.

**Why it doesn’t matter:** First of all, *sack up.* 

Now that we’ve covered that primary reason, the fact of the matter is that default risk will always be a thing for banks. But QFIN isn’t a bank. *(Actually, they technically do have a banking charter in case they have to become one for due to new regulations, but they aren't currently using it.)* Remember their business model I mentioned earlier? 

*Now consider this:* 

Remember that 9.9 billion revenue for the trailing twelve months? Of that 9.9 billion, 2.3 billion is interest income. *(600mm interest expense).* Meanwhile, **they’re receiving 8 billion in service revenue**. (source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN)) They’re bringing in far more money from loan origination commissions and the SaaS fees for their credit analysis than they’re bringing in from actual interest income. In other words, they aren’t a bank. What’s even more important is that QFIN literally does have the best proprietary software, as evidenced by the default rates of their loans. Compare QFIN’s loans defaults to FINV’s, who shot up *90%* yesterday after their earnings call. Go to slide 17: [https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f](https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f) 

If you’re too lazy to click the link, the TL DR is that QFIN’s historical defaults for every tranche is significantly lower. 

Another facet to consider is that even if their interest income does drop significantly, their operating margin is strong and, more importantly, improving. Despite their revenue increasing significantly, “Total operating expenses, excluding provisions were roughly flat Q-on-Q but decreased 33% year-on-year. The year-on-year decline mainly reflects significant improvement in operational efficiency” – CFO Alex “Oh God Please No Not My Face” Xu 

**Third Reason for Doubt – uNaUdiTeD fInAnCiALs**

OK so this is the best criticism the bears have. It’s also the most nebulous. 

A few things to think about: 

This is a Chinese company with Chinese consumer loans on their balance sheet. The QFIN ticker is an ADR. I’m not an accountant, but AFAIK all of the Chinese fintech companies without a US presence use unaudited financials. I don’t think it’s that weird. 

Speaking of accounting, QFIN has a history of overestimating expected losses. *In other words, they used pessimistic estimates that make their financials look worse than they really are.* Back in 2Q2020, Chinese regulators slapped a cap on the interest rate of internet-sourced loans. Some of QFIN’s loans at the time were above that rate, meaning they were impacted. An unscrupulous CFO would not have marked down the loans in anticipation of a decrease in value due to the new, lower interest they would be receiving*. QFIN did the opposite – they devalued the loans by too much* (mostly because they overestimated the default rate). “...the high take rate for capital-light model in the third quarter, maybe partially contributed to a reversal of the charge in the second quarter.” – Ethan “Prolapse King” Wang, paraphrasing something the CFO took two minutes to explain when asked why the loans were doing better than anticipated after being devalued.

**What risks are there still?**

First and foremost, macroeconomic risks. As the Chinese consumer fares, so does QFIN. I view this as a good thing, not a bad one, but it does constitute a risk. Additional regulation from Winnie-The-Pooh represents a risk too, but it looks like, for now, that storm has mostly passed. My take is that the Chinese regulators seemed to have a hard on for fucking up Ant Group – a spinoff of Alibaba. Jack “Actual Vampire” Ma had mouthed off publicly about regulations and so the CCP went after him with even more regulations after disappearing the guy for a month. Ant Group focuses more on microlending, but QFIN’s stock got dragged down by the bears despite not really being exposed to microlending. Ant group is finally approved for their IPO, so it looks like Winnie’s red rocket for regulation is rapidly retracting.

**Any big banana showers coming soon?** YES! **Earnings call on 3/15!** QFIN has a history of smashing earnings estimates. If QFIN has even half the success of FINV, who went up 90% on the day of their earnings call, then it’ll be bananas for everyone. Apes taking a rocket ship to banana planet. 

If you still aren’t convinced just look at the fucking fundamentals you god damn baboon. 

TLDR: I like the stock. 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

1615598198.0,SP,"EDIT3: **WOOOOOOOOO .  Not only did earnings beat, but they straightup said that regulations will not negatively impact them and, in some cases, will actually help them.  The anti-trust regs against tencent's fintech will open up more room for growth for QFIN.**

“ On the regulatory front, we believe that the regulations brought out recently either has minimal impact to our business, or in some cases, even created favorable environment for top platforms like us. As you may already know, the new ruling from the Supreme People’s Court removed the more restrictive lending rate cap for our business. The new guideline on drug lending and micro-lending has a minimal impact on our business as our exposure to both is quite marginal. On the other hand, China’s antitrust and deleveraging push may squeeze some market share away from the industry giants, which will bring us spill over market opportunities” -CEO

This call and the earnings are even better than I was hoping.  Now we just need the market to realize it!  See you all on the moon.

EDIT2: Stock dropped today (3/15) alongside the entire sector.  It isn't dropping on its own - all the chinese fintechs, including the ones that are exposed to microlending, are dropping today.  Good last minute chance to buy, especially since premarket it was actually up 7% haha.  If you're really worried about macroeconomic risk, a good play might be to buy a ITM PUT on a fintech that's exposed, and an ITM call on QFIN. A hedge, so to speak.  But personally i'm not doing that. This is a casino, after all. 
____________
**EDIT: Many people have brought up concern that this stock has already tripled and might be played out. I strongly disagree - from a valuation standpoint it is still an amazing buy. It wasn’t the cash flow or loan quality keeping the price down - it was the regulatory risk. As that risk diminishes it will grow to reach it’s fair valuation, which is around 50 using even a conservative growth rate in a conservative FCFE. The real risk is new regulations, or a bigger impact of the current ones, hence why I spent most of this DD talking about them. Right now the market is pricing in regulations wiping out about half of their revenue sources, which I strongly disagree with.

The earnings call is Monday at 9PM EST, which is Tuesday morning for QFIN in China. The numbers will be interesting but the real catalyst will be management’s discussion of the impact of regulations. Make sure to place all bets by then!**
______________

I have ventured out of my usual territory in my hunt for an exotic rocket ship-shaped banana, and I’ve got good news for all ape-kind: I’ve found one. Here’s my DD (whatever that means). 

Ticker: **QFIN**, AKA ""360 Digitech"". They are a Chinese Fintech company. Currently trading around $31.50. Market Cap is around 4.8 Billion. Very few people in America have heard of them. PE is less than 10, growth is insane, plenty of cash on the balance sheet, low leverage, etc. From a fundamentals or cashflow analysis, this is a banana mine. 

**Here's their business model:**

*First*, they use their online presence to advertise loans to the rapidly-growing Chinese middle class.

*Second*, they use their proprietary risk-assessment tools to analyze the credit-worthiness of the applicants. They also have proprietary identification tools to help prevent fraud and simultaneously speed up the loan process (this is a bigger deal than it sounds like due to the strong desire for convenience in lending) 

*Third*, they partner with banks to supply the capital for the loans. 

*Fourth,* they service the loans and deal with recovery in case of defaults.

The business model is important because in order to understand why this is an amazing buy you also need to understand where their revenue comes from. It's not just loan interest as you would expect.

**But first, let’s talk numbers.** 
*(In RMB, 1 USD = 6.5 RMB / CNY)
2017 Revenue: *175 million* 
2018 Revenue: *3.75 Billion* 
2019 Revenue: *6.99 Billion* 
TTM: *9.19 Billion* (TTM means trailing twelve months, this is 4Q2019 to 3Q2020)

Obviously that’s insane growth. Most apes can’t even count that high. 

And yet, despite that growth, their P/E ratio is a measly **9.4!** *(P/E is a measure of how high up tree us apes must climb to reach banana, lower number = banana more soon)* **That’s less than half the P/E of the S&P 500** *(P/E: 27.5*), **despite having significantly more growth.** 

To understand why the stock is still so cheap, let’s talk about why dumb apes might *NOT* want to buy it. 

Firstly, I assume most of you haven’t bought it yet because you have never heard of it. Do a search for QFIN on reddit – it’s next to impossible to find mention of it here. Furthermore, the trading volume is extremely low…. And most of the ownership is institutional. A few hedge funds, sure, but mostly ETFs, which is exactly what’s caused this great buying opportunity. As most Chinese Fintech stock prices have struggled lately with regulations (with the exception of this week), QFIN is relatively immune from the changes. QFIN has only gone down because most of the ownership is through the sector ETFs, which have been dragging QFIN down with them. Only recently did it buck the trend and move away from its sector's performance, in large part because people are just now starting to notice it.

This is a misunderstood company with obvious value. The play here isn’t that there’s extra value - the value is obvious to everyone - the play is that the “problems” are being significantly exaggerated and misunderstood… so rather than tell you where the deep value is, I will instead focus on why the doubters are wrong and why QFIN is uniquely placed in its sector. 

**First Reason for Doubt – Winnie the Pooh.** The Chinese Fintech industry has recently been slapped with some extra regulations that I had to get my mandarin-speaking wife to translate for me. 

One regulation is that for microlending transactions involving banks and partners, the partners (in this case, QFIN) must contribute at least 25% of the capital. Here’s a breakdown of the rules: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown). *The stock tanked 30% when this happened.*

**Why it doesn’t matter:** According to QFIN’s CEO, Wu “Cock Slapper” Haisheng, *“Currently, the outstanding balance of the outstanding loans issued through our micro lending subsidiary, accounts for less than 1% of the total loan balance, and joint lending accounts for around 0.01%. Therefore, based on our personal evaluation, the new rules will have little impact on our loan origination business.”* 

Another new regulation is that online lending can only be done with banks that are established in the same province as the applicant. This is no problem – QFIN has a multitude of partners in each region. There are other new regulations coming down the pipeline (capital requirements, etc) but QFIN is well capitalized and capable of overcoming all the known issues. 

**Second Reason for Doubt – Default Risk.** There is concern that the loan default rate will be high, especially if China’s economy crashes, and that this will destroy the value of the company similarly to what happened to US banks with bad mortgages in 2008.

**Why it doesn’t matter:** First of all, *sack up.*

I am posting in WSB as I honestly believe it meets the criteria in terms of market cap and retail interest. This post may get auto-deleted or mod-deleted. If it disappears just know that’s it’s not of my fact. I’ve been covering Canoo for a few months so check my post history if you need. 

**Context:** Canoo released the presentation of its new truck on March 11th (YouTube, Instagram etc.). A great new catalyst which was covered by multiple media. Price action went rapidly up after the stock been hammered below $10 on the recent tech growth correction. 

**Options context:** For the last couple of weeks I have noticed that put/call ratio was **massively** skewed towards calls volume i.e. I’m talking near 10 to 1 every single day. Option interest also much bigger on calls side. Although the price of the IV was relatively “cheap” around 100% (for a new public company with long duration growth). 

**Weekly price increase:** The stock went from $11 on Monday until exactly $16.00 today... until something funny happened... [weekly graph](https://ibb.co/Wfhtwm9)

**What I believe happened:** Some big money was too short on the stock that started running way too fast for a mispriced implied volatility of just 100%. The heat intensified and people were more than ever buying calls (like 90% 95% of options volume were calls again). Also these calls are concentrated onto March expiry as there are no weeklies on this name. 

**What I believe they did:** They had to cover their shorts as money was bleeding fast with no sign of any slow down (Canoo was even up 5% PM when all tech growth was in the red). Massive sell wall at 16.00 with more than 100K on the offer. But even after it dropped the stock wanted to moon again and people were still buying calls relentlessly. **They activated the ultra algo** in order to drop the share price as fast and as low as possible in order to trigger stop losses on calls. Specifically on MAR 15CALLS. 

**Evidence:** Look again at the [screenshot.](https://ibb.co/r7YhN6N)

At time 12:59:50 and 12:59:51 you will see that within **one second** big quantities were bought at the lowest prices of the day (0.35 to 0.45) then 3 seconds later it went back up to regular prices and quantities. This is the evidence that someone has triggered a sell off on Canoo stock to trigger stop losses on MAR 15C for the algo to buy absolutely everything it could within 1 second. It happened so fast that you couldn’t even feel it. Only an algo was capable to perform this. I had to dig into time/sales to decipher what happened.

**ELI5** Why buy calls if they are short? HF was about to lose too much money on shorting Canoo a retail darling that wants to moon hard. They couldn’t control the price action anymore. They had to hedge their short by getting long calls and mitigate their potential loss. They scooped more than 1K MAR 15C at around 0.42 average price and within the next few seconds it went back to 0.80 and then minutes later to 1.00. All this happened at plain sight before you had time to blink. Now don’t expect media talking about this kind of stuff. They too busy witch hunting retail. This post may also get censored anyway.

I’ve tried my best to make this a quick and simple post. I’ve explained it at the best of my understanding. Obviously not a recommendation to buy sell hold any security. I shared public data. My interpretations could be erroneous. 

**Bonus S3 short data** on Canoo: 
short interest is $152M
10.33M shares shorted
10.33% of Float
9.37% S3 SI% Float
47.82% fee.
Shares shorted up +1.6 million shares, worth $23 million, +13.3%, last week.

**TLDR** HF got caught asleep at the wheel shorting Canoo. Retail likes it too much and wanna moon. They had to buy next week calls ASAP and as cheap as possible. Used algo ultra fast. One second later: thank you very much for cheap calls.",Canoo was algo attacked today probably to cover shorts,m3tpkt,128,420,0.9,420,0,,Discussion,False,True,1

United Wholesale Mortgage is an amazing buy that I think has both long term and short term potential. I will admit, I don't know a lot about stocks, but when I look at UWMC I see value town for days. I wouldn't call this DD because I just googled stuff.

**Who Is UWMC and What Do They Do?**

UWMC underwrites loans for brokers, banks, and credit unions. They do it all- FHA, Conventional, VA, the works. Their primary business however seems to be with brokers. Now what is a mortgage broker? No really I had to google this to get a better understanding. Mortgage brokers essentially take your info, screen it, and then look at the variety of home loan options available to you and aim to get you the best deal in return (usually) for a small fee. Mortgage brokers currently make up a little over 20% of the housing market vs. 7% 2011 and 16% in 2019. They essentially help people find the best deal on the market to help finance their home, and seem to be popular among millennial homebuyers. With mortgage brokers shares growing in the mortgage space this gives UWM great growth potential (I think).

**What is UWMC's Edge?**

Now what differentiates them from other companies? Well one is their fast turnaround times. UWMC proprietary tech that allows for the quickest turnaround time in the market due to streamlined efficiency. That tech alone makes them convenient for the broker and home buyer. This makes the loan process insanely fast vs their competitors who can take a longer time to close the deal. They've built strong relations within the broker community and appear to have a symbiotic relationship with the brokers they work with.

**UWMC Ultimatum**

There's been a lot of speculation over that Chad Ishbia's ultimatum to the brokers- sign the addendum by 03/15 saying you will halt working with Fairway and RKT. Well 90% of their brokers signed it, so I think this narrative is overplayed quite a bit. Like I said, UWMC and brokers work together to profit in a symbiotic fashion. Brokers are the face and voice you see UWM directs them traffic, they each get a cut, both walk away happy with fast turnaround times/best deal for their customers. According to UWMC, RKT has gone out of their way to bypass broker's. RKT is better off offering them a rate, bypass the broker, make more money cutting out the middle man (I may be under simplifying this or have it wrong). Rocket Mortgage is not interested in working with individual brokers when they have an in house team to help keep it all in the family.

**The Value Short Term**

Short term I think we have a few key things coming up.

* [u/faisall1](https://www.reddit.com/user/faisall1/) is convinced there's a short squeeze, if you wanna see his DD on that it's here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3o6bu/uwmc\_part\_4\_when\_the\_squozes\_keep\_on\_squoozing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3o6bu/uwmc_part_4_when_the_squozes_keep_on_squoozing/) I hope this is why I've been getting fed red crayons.
* Addendum Deadline is 03/15, looks like a majority of brokers have agreed which at the very minimum shouldn't hurt their bottom line. Looks like a win-win for the UWM-Broker channel
* Russell 1000/3000 Addition on 03/22
* Q1 Earnings Report after destroying their Q4 numbers. Housing volume Remains low, demand remains high. Despite Treasury Yield + Mortgage Rate Increase I think we're gonna see good numbers here. Also I like dividends.

&#x200B;

**The Long Term Value**

The individual broker is not going away, UWM has made quick turnaround times standard for brokers and homebuyers increasing the speed and quality of service you get from an individual broker. The growth of the broker sector is a positive for both homebuyers and UWM, I like my quarterly dividends, and the stock is just way too undervalued here. Every analysis I see online has a target price of $11\~$13, so it's at a discount at $8.30 right now. UWM has rock solid financials. UWMC has a PE of 6.17 and PS of 3.84 vs. RKT with a PE 2.06 and a PS of 8.46. Look, I'm not the smartest guy, but I can clearly see that UWM has a distinct edge in the home loan market. I think UWM has a wide valuation between $11\~$16 in a fair market all things equal.

I took my tendies and yeeted them all into UWMC. 374 share and x3 $9 calls 05/21.

&#x200B;

TL;DR UWM has been feeding me red crayons, but I feel like it's gonna give me green ones soon. I like dividends because I'm big boomer.",Why UWMC has Value in Both the Long and Short Term,m3t0k9,59,361,0.87,361,0,,Discussion,False,True,1

You should listen to nothing I say Bruh

But look bruh...

Bruh, I'm Glad your back bruh,

Dude bruh I was so high bruh... I was so fuckin' high...

and everything was cool Mann and then like I smelled smoke brooo

Shit was on fire mannn  and it was the **50 day MVA** and it was over my head bruh,

you don't understand bro

# The 50 day MVA was over my head 

Today started out like many others, GOEV bulling out the gate and just destroying shit. We did this before. Released the hordes over ran silly sell walls, kicked in doors took plunder and moved on.  In the distance was the prize. Gleaming 16$.  It was the only thing between us and the sick GammaRamp Dildo of Naughty Gainz posting.

We ran up on it, Got pushed back, Ran up on it again and again got pushed back off the stage, Voltron jumps up, swerves fakes, and then does the Philadelphia eagle all over Gojira's face.

For the rest of the morning Voltron and Godzilla are fighting on a cliff edge for fucking hours.  Hours on this tightrope edge. Shit is going down. Couches are getting broken in half and thrown into the mc Donald's ball pit. The toddlers are running the daycare. The candy jar is empty at the nurses station. Fuck, I forgot its our anniversary again.

The party is on fire. There is no driver at the wheel.

But the crowd roars when Voltron drops a back cracker on Gojira.  Theres voltron kicking the shit out of a big lizard, people cheering from the balcony, hes looking hot. You're all smug looking at your mad gainz.   Gojira is all beaten up, getting tossed around.   Cup to Handle Voltron climbs on top of the ring and jumps arm out stretched, Gojira rolls out of the way and bam theres Mecha all dazed, Gojira starts winning some more fist fights, the mecha is sparking, slipping... loosing his groove...

the fans we're a little nervous, some people are even switching to some copium..

""We want them to accumulate SI here...""  ""When the big boys get back from lunch, they'll make the move. Junior traders don't know the MechaBot kungfu and aren't authorized to deploy lightning sword...""

Round 12:30 the handle started smoothing out and the bull flag banner started to lean farther and farther over till...

12:50 on the money Godzilla just straight kicks Voltron in the nuts

**World Star**

and that's exactly where everyone who bought tickets to this ride after 10:00 today was sitting.

**You just paid money to have a gigantic lizard kick you in your robotic nuts.**

10 minutes later the bosses get back from lunch and want to know what the fuck just happened.

# Welcome to the Jungle... I was wrong about yesterday.

Today was the day shit got real.  A big boy woke up and put us on notice that they aren't going down without a fight.  Luckily we have the battlefield for now.  EVs are hot.  Capital seems to be leaving other plays and flowing to Canoo.  Macro is good. Nasdaq set for a run.  We got Roth in a few days and even with all that bear violence we performed well.  Our Gamma Ramp is  still quite lopsided see the [comment](https://i.imgur.com/LIsnoKy.png) below by /u/krvrotmg.  OI is positive... intraday selloff is irrelevant below.

I bought the dip a bit. Won't lie.  The thesis is still in place...  We took a beating and continued to raise the price this is highly bullish. However, You might still be holding a gun, but admit it... you got a little nervous there didn't you. I'll write something deep and thinky bullish for Monday.

In the end I will give the big lizard this.

That was a pretty fucking smart move.

1615584210.0,ANY,"What would the ratings on stocks be if they actually traded based on fundamentals?  Well lets find out:

The list of stocks are all companies I like.  They are all on my list of stocks to watch for wheel trades.  These are all companies that I would want to own if the price was right.

&#x200B;

Since stock prices are usually based on perception of future performance, for each stock I looked up its estimated price earnings for 2021.  I ignored 2020 completely.  If it is a spec stock expected to loose money in 2021 I estimated its first profitable year in say 2022.  If I thought the CNBC estimate for 2021 was good I used it.  Otherwise I upped it a little or lowered it a little based on my opinion of future earnings.

&#x200B;

I also used CNBC's numbers for past earnings to estimate what I thought the growth rate for the next few years would be.  Again I ignore 2020.

&#x200B;

I then find a price target of earnings \* 2 \* growth rate.  The only exception was Hasbro which is a dividend stock.

&#x200B;

I then calculated a price I would want to own the stock at which is usually about 70% of price target or 1.4 \* earnings \* growth.

&#x200B;

If a stock is trading at PE of more than 2 times growth rate it is rated a SELL

If a stock is trading at a PE between 1.4 and 2 times growth it is rated a HOLD

If a stock is trading under 1.4 growth it is rated a buy.

If it is trading at a PE of under its growth I rated it a STRONG BUY.

Other than Hasbro I did not take dividends, revenue, or assets under consideration.  This was a simple calculation.  Therefore THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE YOU SHOULD DO YOUR OWN DD BEFORE BUYING, SELLING, OR HOLDING ANY STOCK!!!

&#x200B;

Also, I did not take squeezes into consideration they are ONLY based on future fundes.

&#x200B;

I think the results will be SHOCKING!

&#x200B;

Yes I used excel I know I suck.

1615582214.0,AMZN,"**$LUMN - Lumen Technologies (Formerly CenturyLink) by** u/uknj

Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) is a telecommunications company which provides products and services related Network, Cloud, Security, Voice, and Managed Services to enterprise, SME, and retail customers. Lumen is aiming to position itself as a key infrastructure partner underpinning public and private cloud, edge computing and fiber connectivity. LUMN is building its services with 4 key areas in mind:

1. Physical assets and infrastructure – These include fiber, hardware and facilities.
2. Software managed networking – This is a network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering that can be leveraged to connect organisations with
3. Hybrid Cloud – These include private cloud and datacentres, colocation services and connections with public cloud service provider partners.
4. Lumen Orchestrator – This is the orchestration solution that allows for the management and control of the various services that are offered.

I am currently bearish about LUMN with no immediate plans to invest (although in the event of the price dropping into the single digits, I would re-evaluate this position). There are a few key reasons for this, but I encourage you to read the full bullish, bearish, and neutral considerations in the rest of the post:

1. LUMN earns a significant portion of its revenues from legacy offerings e.g., traditional telephony. This revenue stream has been decreasing YoY for the last few years and this is likely to continue.
2. Despite the above, there are significant areas of potential for LUMN – specifically in their Edge Computing and software defined networking offerings (see Organisational Summary below). Edge Computing is only a small % of current revenues and while it is likely to grow, it will take time to significantly grow these streams. I view the Edge Computing growth as a slow burner and small market, but this will grow at a rapid rate in the future.
3. LUMN has a high level of debt, and while they have managed to de-lever and reduce interest rates, the amount of debt is still significant. When accounting for intangibles and goodwill, the level of liabilities is roughly 1.6x the value of assets (although specifically looking at long term debt this is a healthier picture at 70% of non-current assets).
4. Revenues have been consecutively down for the last few years and are unlikely to show a significant turnaround next year. This is somewhat mitigated by improvements in margin which are expected to continue and a healthy level of free cash flow at $2,770 although this has been declining YoY.

Please do have a read of the Bull, Bear and Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced and in-depth view.

# Key Data

All data believed to be accurate as of 05/03/2021

* Price = $13.45
* P/E = -12x
* EPS = -2.12 (dil)
* Forward P/E = 8.5x

# Detailed Analysis

**Bull Considerations**

* $LUMN are well positioned to become significant players in high potential markets – specifically fiber and underlying network infrastructure, NaaS and Edge computing.
* $LUMN has several verticals it can offer to customers including Hybrid Cloud, Connected Security and Collaboration. These can be leveraged to grow revenue streams in parallel (i.e., cross selling products and services to customers).
* Successfully managed to de-lever the company from previous debts. While this is a great deleveraging trend and a significant reduction in interest rates by redeeming outstanding 5.375% and 7.00% notes1 and replacing them with 4% bonds, the level of debt is still a concern (see bearish consideration item 1).
* The dividend from $LUMN has been consistent and relatively attractive (although on a yield basis this is less so if the price continues to rise). The board are committed to continuing the dividend payment and at the present time it can be safely assumed that $0.25 will be paid per share per quarter for the remainder of FY21. Dividend yield should not be the primary reason for going into $LUMN as yield is \~ 7% (at a stock price of $13.70). In the event of a dip to single digits, the dividend becomes extremely attractive and is worth considering (at a yield of > 9%).
* Despite the overall reduction in EBITDA (see bearish item 4), EBITDA margin has improved and is likely to continue improving into FY21 due to cost cutting measures being pushed by executive leadership.
* Significant number of insider purchases throughout 2020 with one sale.

**Bear Considerations**

* Overall, there are likely to be better candidates for returns on investments than LUMN, while LUMN is in a number of attractive areas, it is still growing revenues and these are unlikely to materialise in any significant manner over the next year or two. See competitive advantage section for additional details.
* $LUMN holds significant long-term debt of $31,837 (down from $34,694 in 2019). This debt is primarily due to $LUMN’s all in play to fiber (at the expense of 5g) when they purchased Level 3 Communications for $34,000. It is worth noting that $LUMN has not had an issue with either paying down debt and paying dividends with its current cash flow.
* $LUMN earns a substantial portion of revenues from legacy services. These include voice ($391 in 4Q20) which approximates to 29% of overall revenue. As can probably be guessed, this has regularly declined over the course of FY20. While not all the voice revenue is likely to be a “legacy” product, I am considering it as such as there are likely to be other legacy revenue streams. (N.B. According to $LUMN legacy revenues primarily include voice, private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services.)
* $LUMN is facing lengthening sales cycles for its products and services as their customers (and more likely organisations in general) continue to evaluate new infrastructure needs and delay purchasing unless necessary. This is likely to continue until at least 2022 as cost pressure at organisations globally push down purchases.
* Revenues are down both QoQ and YoY with EBITDA down YoY and there is no expectation that they will increase next year with best estimates at stable revenue / EBITDA and worst-case a reduction. YoY revenues have decreased for both FY20, FY19 and FY18, although the rate of decrease has reduced over time.
* Free cash flow while still high is reducing over time and will continue to do so as LUMN are likely to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and paying off its long-term debt.
* Executive compensation (specifically focussing on CEO compensation) is above average for the industry at $17M (compared to an average of $10M for similar sizes). It is worth noting that when comparing against larger companies or those listed as competitors, this level of compensation was not unusual. Compensation did stabilise as performance dropped, however, no decrease in compensation occurred despite the decrease in earnings. While not initially a problem, if the results do not turn around, and there is no decrease in compensation, there is a concern that executive pay is no longer in line with the company’s results.

**Neutral Considerations**

* Long term credit rating (Moody’s) – Ba3: Speculative with substantial - high credit risk.
* Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings – SGL-2: Good liquidity, will be able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months through mostly internal resources but may rely on external sources of committed financing.
* Southeastern Asset Management has increased its position in $LUMN as of Dec 2020. It is worth noting that they have lost (\~25%) on the investment to date2. Despite this, they remain bullish on the overall prospects as the CEO has tightened controls on costs and margin improves. Additionally, they believe $LUMN can monetise several segments they are in (specifically fiber), and that as a multiple of free cash flow (< 5 at the time of investing) is an attractive valuation. As a final point, they have signed an NDA with $LUMN, and this indicates a higher and more “activist” level of engagement3. I have listed this as neutral despite the bullish sentiment of SAM, as their track record for the last year has not been great compared to the overall market.
* $LUMN will be seeing reduced subsidy revenue (from CAF II – A US initiative to improve connectivity) with subsidies declining to $20 by 2022. However, $LUMN believes their investment into providing this connectivity is likely to add to revenue that will make up for the loss in subsidy.

1. **Adaptive Networking** – High performance network connectivity i.e., on premise private lines, Content Delivery Network, fiber internet connectivity, direct cloud connections (where they provide corporate WAN infrastructure a direct link to Cloud) and managed networking services / consulting.

* Content delivery network market growth is forecast to grow at 14% till 20254.
* Fiber Internet connectivity in the US grew at 12% from 2019-202022 and will likely continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years. Across the EU growth rates are largely similar for both coverage growth and subscriber growth5.
* Software defined networking offerings (Networking as a service) is an expanding industry and likely to see significant growth of 34% annually till 20266.
* Growth rates and industry sizes for private lines and direct cloud connections are not easily available. I believe direct cloud connections are a growth area and likely to grow at a reasonable 10-15% annually for the next few years (based on over all cloud growth, increase in colocation and deployment of data centres – see Hybrid Cloud below).

1. **Collaboration** \- VOIP, teleconferencing, collaboration solutions (e.g., file sharing and virtual meeting rooms all hosted by Lumen, but the products can be from vendors like Zoom, Webex Skype etc.), contact centres and calling services (e.g., traditional phone style calling both locally and internationally as well as toll free / business numbers. Also advanced emergency services support).

* VOIP is relatively mature industry with a CAGR of 12% (at best) till 20257. Personally, I think we can discount any mobile VOIP growth as I do not believe LUMN has offerings in this space and in my view, this would lower the effective CAGR with 8-10% looking a more reasonable target.
* Call centre growth is forecast to grow at 6% till 20278. The US houses over 60% of call centres globally, and this number is only going to decrease as increased internet penetration and decreased telecom rates drive the outsourcing of call centres9.
* Numbers and growth rates to traditional telephony are limited but I imagine that growth is probably negative. For toll free, business numbers and emergency services support, growth is likely positive but limited.
* Collaboration solutions are growing at a reasonably high rate of 13% till 202710. However, LUMN is limited to managing, implementing, running, and hosting products from other vendors as they do not sell their own.

1. **Connected Security** – Threat management (managed threat intelligence), managed SOC services, WAF and DDoS mitigation, managed firewalls, and professional services.

* The WAF market is expected to grow at 18% annually till 202211.
* The DDoS mitigation market is set to grow at 15% annually till 202612.
* The managed security services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% till 202513. While I think managed firewall growth is likely to be less than other managed security services (e.g., IAM, SOC etc), a growth rate of 4-6% is probable.

1. Edge Computing – Managed services, connections to both public cloud and private data centres, networking, colocation, cloud. Essentially connecting edge locations / end user servers to backbone infrastructure.

* Edge computing as an industry is forecast to grow at \~25% annually till 202514. However, it is currently a small market valued at \~ $ 2,000 in 20201. Edge computing as a market can be further subdivided into hardware, platform, and services. Hardware is expected to grow at the fastest rate of the three potentially reaching 40%15.

1. **Hybrid Cloud** – Cloud storage, disaster recovery (data replication and business continuity), hosting services, data centres, private and public cloud alongside consulting for cloud.

* The private cloud market is expected to grow at 29% annually till 2025. Private cloud growth will primarily be driven by businesses who wish to take advantage of public cloud capability with the addition of potentially more secure and customisable hosting resources. On-premises cloud growth will be significantly lower than provider hosted options (PaaS / IaaS) which are likely to hit 50%16.
* Hosting services are likely to increase in market size by 15% annually17.
* Deployment of data centres are likely to increase slowly over the next few years with a growth rate not likely to exceed 10% (estimated at 6% for 202118). Similarly, colocation services are likely to see a modest 14% CAGR19.
* Global cloud storage is expected to increase at a rate of 20% till 202520.

# Competitive Advantage

1. **Adaptive Networking:**

* Summary: A large revenue earner with solid growth potential. $LUMN is a large player in the infrastructure space and should be able to leverage that to provide organisations with NaaS and global fiber connectivity.
* From a coverage perspective (compared to Verizon and AT&T as of 2019), $LUMN serves 16% of the population, with Verizon and AT&T serving 17% and 41% respectively. It is worth noting that $LUMN covers more states than either21, 22. N.B. this view is for consumers but presumably also can also be applied to corporate coverage.
* $LUMN is relatively well positioned from a fiber perspective as they have a lot of “unique coverage” (i.e., locations served without significant competition) in the US and have coverage in Europe and Asia. They carry a large portion of internet traffic on their network backbone and have 180,000 locations globally which provide their customers direct access to $LUMN infrastructure. Additionally, they have direct connectivity to several cloud service providers and data centres. Compared to competitors, they appear to have the largest total fiber route23.
* The software defined networking offerings are an exciting growth opportunity and combined with the strong infrastructure position of $LUMN will mean that customers (particularly those that are multinationals and large enterprises) can utilise the network as a service offering to connect their enterprise infrastructure efficiently and effectively across the globe including connections from on-premises to cloud service providers.
* While competitors do exist, from both a software defined networking perspective (e.g., Fortinet, Cato etc.) and an infrastructure perspective (e.g. Verizon, AT&T etc.) $LUMN has the advantage of being a strong player in both areas with good partnerships with Cisco and VMWare.

1. **Collaboration:**

* Summary: Largely a legacy business and revenue generator for $LUMN. This will be a shrinking revenue area for $LUMN as the decline in traditional legacy telephony services is unlikely to be made up for by any growth in VoIP or collaboration solutions. Additionally, this area is a large revenue earner for $LUMN, and significant declines here would result in material impact to value.
* While implementing and managing VoIP, teleconferencing and collaboration solutions with partnered vendors (e.g., Zoom) are likely to show some little to moderate growth over the coming years, they will likely provide consistent revenue due to the underlying network requirements needed to effectively utilise such solutions.
* Traditional telephony services including contact / service centres and business telephony service revenues are likely to shrink over the coming few years.

1. **Connected Security:**

* Summary: The cybersecurity market is an exciting growth area which holds significant potential for $LUMN. However, it remains a small % of overall revenues and so revenue growth in-line with industry expectation will not materially impact the overall value of $LUMN.
* If $LUMN can leverage their verticals in the datacentre / cloud space to cross sell their security services this could see some reasonably large growth, but overall due to the small footprint of $LUMN in the cloud space presently, material value growth due to this vertical is likely be several years out.
* Additionally, $LUMN is not a recognised global player in this industry unlike Akamai or NetScout, and so will be at a disadvantage compared to incumbents with higher profile portfolios.

1. **Edge Computing:**

* Summary: This could be a strong growth area for $LUMN. Could be a way to take advantage of the potentially significant growth area of Edge computing. However, it is likely to significantly materialise only 1-2 years out with little revenue growth in this area prior to then as organisations slowly accept this paradigm shift. Additionally, it will be a highly competitive area that will require significant investment to grow and maintain an advantage.
* As of 23 Feb 2021, $LUMN claims they provide 60% of enterprise locations with <5ms latency to edge nodes. Their goal is 90% by the end of the year and their large fiber network leaves them at an advantage compared to competitors. (See Adaptive Networking).
* An example from the 4Q20 earnings call was SAP using their Edge infrastructure to bring SaaS applications closer to customers and bypassing unnecessary internet traversal.
* While $LUMN can leverage its underlying infrastructure and assets to push a solid offering, this is likely to be a highly competitive space with players including typical cloud service providers e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and HPE as well as specialised players e.g. Mutable. Large cloud players will have both the hardware and software required to compete effectively with $LUMN while also being able to leverage their substantial public cloud technologies to gain an advantage.

1. **Hybrid Cloud:**

* Summary: If you are interested in taking advantage of private or public cloud growth then Lumen probably is not the best value even at its current multiple. This is due to low revenues (as a % of total revenues) from Cloud related activities. Additionally, this space is highly competitive and $LUMN does not appear to have the background or experience (it is working on growing its employee expertise) although they can potentially take advantage of their underlying infrastructure from their fiber and physical assets.
* Personally, I believe Private Cloud is not a significantly growing area with potentially some shorter term increase due to pandemic pushing a more remote working / access focus. However, longer term 3-5 years out, I think hybrid cloud will be the dominant focus as organisations transition from private cloud to increased public cloud usage. Only 3% of enterprises use private cloud exclusively24.
* If you are going to opt for growth within public cloud, there are higher growth options with AMZN, GOOG and MSFT although these are substantially higher in price. Alternatively, Cisco, HPE, or other smaller providers may work. A dedicated cloud provider will likely provide better value than $LUMN due to the low revenue share (see above).

1615582214.0,GOOG,"**$LUMN - Lumen Technologies (Formerly CenturyLink) by** u/uknj

Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) is a telecommunications company which provides products and services related Network, Cloud, Security, Voice, and Managed Services to enterprise, SME, and retail customers. Lumen is aiming to position itself as a key infrastructure partner underpinning public and private cloud, edge computing and fiber connectivity. LUMN is building its services with 4 key areas in mind:

1. Physical assets and infrastructure – These include fiber, hardware and facilities.
2. Software managed networking – This is a network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering that can be leveraged to connect organisations with
3. Hybrid Cloud – These include private cloud and datacentres, colocation services and connections with public cloud service provider partners.
4. Lumen Orchestrator – This is the orchestration solution that allows for the management and control of the various services that are offered.

I am currently bearish about LUMN with no immediate plans to invest (although in the event of the price dropping into the single digits, I would re-evaluate this position). There are a few key reasons for this, but I encourage you to read the full bullish, bearish, and neutral considerations in the rest of the post:

1. LUMN earns a significant portion of its revenues from legacy offerings e.g., traditional telephony. This revenue stream has been decreasing YoY for the last few years and this is likely to continue.
2. Despite the above, there are significant areas of potential for LUMN – specifically in their Edge Computing and software defined networking offerings (see Organisational Summary below). Edge Computing is only a small % of current revenues and while it is likely to grow, it will take time to significantly grow these streams. I view the Edge Computing growth as a slow burner and small market, but this will grow at a rapid rate in the future.
3. LUMN has a high level of debt, and while they have managed to de-lever and reduce interest rates, the amount of debt is still significant. When accounting for intangibles and goodwill, the level of liabilities is roughly 1.6x the value of assets (although specifically looking at long term debt this is a healthier picture at 70% of non-current assets).
4. Revenues have been consecutively down for the last few years and are unlikely to show a significant turnaround next year. This is somewhat mitigated by improvements in margin which are expected to continue and a healthy level of free cash flow at $2,770 although this has been declining YoY.

Please do have a read of the Bull, Bear and Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced and in-depth view.

# Key Data

All data believed to be accurate as of 05/03/2021

* Price = $13.45
* P/E = -12x
* EPS = -2.12 (dil)
* Forward P/E = 8.5x

# Detailed Analysis

**Bull Considerations**

* $LUMN are well positioned to become significant players in high potential markets – specifically fiber and underlying network infrastructure, NaaS and Edge computing.
* $LUMN has several verticals it can offer to customers including Hybrid Cloud, Connected Security and Collaboration. These can be leveraged to grow revenue streams in parallel (i.e., cross selling products and services to customers).
* Successfully managed to de-lever the company from previous debts. While this is a great deleveraging trend and a significant reduction in interest rates by redeeming outstanding 5.375% and 7.00% notes1 and replacing them with 4% bonds, the level of debt is still a concern (see bearish consideration item 1).
* The dividend from $LUMN has been consistent and relatively attractive (although on a yield basis this is less so if the price continues to rise). The board are committed to continuing the dividend payment and at the present time it can be safely assumed that $0.25 will be paid per share per quarter for the remainder of FY21. Dividend yield should not be the primary reason for going into $LUMN as yield is \~ 7% (at a stock price of $13.70). In the event of a dip to single digits, the dividend becomes extremely attractive and is worth considering (at a yield of > 9%).
* Despite the overall reduction in EBITDA (see bearish item 4), EBITDA margin has improved and is likely to continue improving into FY21 due to cost cutting measures being pushed by executive leadership.
* Significant number of insider purchases throughout 2020 with one sale.

**Bear Considerations**

* Overall, there are likely to be better candidates for returns on investments than LUMN, while LUMN is in a number of attractive areas, it is still growing revenues and these are unlikely to materialise in any significant manner over the next year or two. See competitive advantage section for additional details.
* $LUMN holds significant long-term debt of $31,837 (down from $34,694 in 2019). This debt is primarily due to $LUMN’s all in play to fiber (at the expense of 5g) when they purchased Level 3 Communications for $34,000. It is worth noting that $LUMN has not had an issue with either paying down debt and paying dividends with its current cash flow.
* $LUMN earns a substantial portion of revenues from legacy services. These include voice ($391 in 4Q20) which approximates to 29% of overall revenue. As can probably be guessed, this has regularly declined over the course of FY20. While not all the voice revenue is likely to be a “legacy” product, I am considering it as such as there are likely to be other legacy revenue streams. (N.B. According to $LUMN legacy revenues primarily include voice, private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services.)
* $LUMN is facing lengthening sales cycles for its products and services as their customers (and more likely organisations in general) continue to evaluate new infrastructure needs and delay purchasing unless necessary. This is likely to continue until at least 2022 as cost pressure at organisations globally push down purchases.
* Revenues are down both QoQ and YoY with EBITDA down YoY and there is no expectation that they will increase next year with best estimates at stable revenue / EBITDA and worst-case a reduction. YoY revenues have decreased for both FY20, FY19 and FY18, although the rate of decrease has reduced over time.
* Free cash flow while still high is reducing over time and will continue to do so as LUMN are likely to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and paying off its long-term debt.
* Executive compensation (specifically focussing on CEO compensation) is above average for the industry at $17M (compared to an average of $10M for similar sizes). It is worth noting that when comparing against larger companies or those listed as competitors, this level of compensation was not unusual. Compensation did stabilise as performance dropped, however, no decrease in compensation occurred despite the decrease in earnings. While not initially a problem, if the results do not turn around, and there is no decrease in compensation, there is a concern that executive pay is no longer in line with the company’s results.

**Neutral Considerations**

* Long term credit rating (Moody’s) – Ba3: Speculative with substantial - high credit risk.
* Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings – SGL-2: Good liquidity, will be able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months through mostly internal resources but may rely on external sources of committed financing.
* Southeastern Asset Management has increased its position in $LUMN as of Dec 2020. It is worth noting that they have lost (\~25%) on the investment to date2. Despite this, they remain bullish on the overall prospects as the CEO has tightened controls on costs and margin improves. Additionally, they believe $LUMN can monetise several segments they are in (specifically fiber), and that as a multiple of free cash flow (< 5 at the time of investing) is an attractive valuation. As a final point, they have signed an NDA with $LUMN, and this indicates a higher and more “activist” level of engagement3. I have listed this as neutral despite the bullish sentiment of SAM, as their track record for the last year has not been great compared to the overall market.
* $LUMN will be seeing reduced subsidy revenue (from CAF II – A US initiative to improve connectivity) with subsidies declining to $20 by 2022. However, $LUMN believes their investment into providing this connectivity is likely to add to revenue that will make up for the loss in subsidy.

* Summary: If you are interested in taking advantage of private or public cloud growth then Lumen probably is not the best value even at its current multiple. This is due to low revenues (as a % of total revenues) from Cloud related activities. Additionally, this space is highly competitive and $LUMN does not appear to have the background or experience (it is working on growing its employee expertise) although they can potentially take advantage of their underlying infrastructure from their fiber and physical assets.
* Personally, I believe Private Cloud is not a significantly growing area with potentially some shorter term increase due to pandemic pushing a more remote working / access focus. However, longer term 3-5 years out, I think hybrid cloud will be the dominant focus as organisations transition from private cloud to increased public cloud usage. Only 3% of enterprises use private cloud exclusively24.
* If you are going to opt for growth within public cloud, there are higher growth options with AMZN, GOOG and MSFT although these are substantially higher in price. Alternatively, Cisco, HPE, or other smaller providers may work. A dedicated cloud provider will likely provide better value than $LUMN due to the low revenue share (see above).

This is not investment advice.",$LUMN - Lumen Technologies (Formerly CenturyLink) by u/uknj,m3qtir,52,152,0.92,152,0,,DD,False,True,-1
1615582214.0,MSFT,"**$LUMN - Lumen Technologies (Formerly CenturyLink) by** u/uknj

Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) is a telecommunications company which provides products and services related Network, Cloud, Security, Voice, and Managed Services to enterprise, SME, and retail customers. Lumen is aiming to position itself as a key infrastructure partner underpinning public and private cloud, edge computing and fiber connectivity. LUMN is building its services with 4 key areas in mind:

1. Physical assets and infrastructure – These include fiber, hardware and facilities.
2. Software managed networking – This is a network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering that can be leveraged to connect organisations with
3. Hybrid Cloud – These include private cloud and datacentres, colocation services and connections with public cloud service provider partners.
4. Lumen Orchestrator – This is the orchestration solution that allows for the management and control of the various services that are offered.

I am currently bearish about LUMN with no immediate plans to invest (although in the event of the price dropping into the single digits, I would re-evaluate this position). There are a few key reasons for this, but I encourage you to read the full bullish, bearish, and neutral considerations in the rest of the post:

1. LUMN earns a significant portion of its revenues from legacy offerings e.g., traditional telephony. This revenue stream has been decreasing YoY for the last few years and this is likely to continue.
2. Despite the above, there are significant areas of potential for LUMN – specifically in their Edge Computing and software defined networking offerings (see Organisational Summary below). Edge Computing is only a small % of current revenues and while it is likely to grow, it will take time to significantly grow these streams. I view the Edge Computing growth as a slow burner and small market, but this will grow at a rapid rate in the future.
3. LUMN has a high level of debt, and while they have managed to de-lever and reduce interest rates, the amount of debt is still significant. When accounting for intangibles and goodwill, the level of liabilities is roughly 1.6x the value of assets (although specifically looking at long term debt this is a healthier picture at 70% of non-current assets).
4. Revenues have been consecutively down for the last few years and are unlikely to show a significant turnaround next year. This is somewhat mitigated by improvements in margin which are expected to continue and a healthy level of free cash flow at $2,770 although this has been declining YoY.

Please do have a read of the Bull, Bear and Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced and in-depth view.

# Key Data

All data believed to be accurate as of 05/03/2021

* Price = $13.45
* P/E = -12x
* EPS = -2.12 (dil)
* Forward P/E = 8.5x

# Detailed Analysis

**Bull Considerations**

* $LUMN are well positioned to become significant players in high potential markets – specifically fiber and underlying network infrastructure, NaaS and Edge computing.
* $LUMN has several verticals it can offer to customers including Hybrid Cloud, Connected Security and Collaboration. These can be leveraged to grow revenue streams in parallel (i.e., cross selling products and services to customers).
* Successfully managed to de-lever the company from previous debts. While this is a great deleveraging trend and a significant reduction in interest rates by redeeming outstanding 5.375% and 7.00% notes1 and replacing them with 4% bonds, the level of debt is still a concern (see bearish consideration item 1).
* The dividend from $LUMN has been consistent and relatively attractive (although on a yield basis this is less so if the price continues to rise). The board are committed to continuing the dividend payment and at the present time it can be safely assumed that $0.25 will be paid per share per quarter for the remainder of FY21. Dividend yield should not be the primary reason for going into $LUMN as yield is \~ 7% (at a stock price of $13.70). In the event of a dip to single digits, the dividend becomes extremely attractive and is worth considering (at a yield of > 9%).
* Despite the overall reduction in EBITDA (see bearish item 4), EBITDA margin has improved and is likely to continue improving into FY21 due to cost cutting measures being pushed by executive leadership.
* Significant number of insider purchases throughout 2020 with one sale.

**Bear Considerations**

* Overall, there are likely to be better candidates for returns on investments than LUMN, while LUMN is in a number of attractive areas, it is still growing revenues and these are unlikely to materialise in any significant manner over the next year or two. See competitive advantage section for additional details.
* $LUMN holds significant long-term debt of $31,837 (down from $34,694 in 2019). This debt is primarily due to $LUMN’s all in play to fiber (at the expense of 5g) when they purchased Level 3 Communications for $34,000. It is worth noting that $LUMN has not had an issue with either paying down debt and paying dividends with its current cash flow.
* $LUMN earns a substantial portion of revenues from legacy services. These include voice ($391 in 4Q20) which approximates to 29% of overall revenue. As can probably be guessed, this has regularly declined over the course of FY20. While not all the voice revenue is likely to be a “legacy” product, I am considering it as such as there are likely to be other legacy revenue streams. (N.B. According to $LUMN legacy revenues primarily include voice, private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services.)
* $LUMN is facing lengthening sales cycles for its products and services as their customers (and more likely organisations in general) continue to evaluate new infrastructure needs and delay purchasing unless necessary. This is likely to continue until at least 2022 as cost pressure at organisations globally push down purchases.
* Revenues are down both QoQ and YoY with EBITDA down YoY and there is no expectation that they will increase next year with best estimates at stable revenue / EBITDA and worst-case a reduction. YoY revenues have decreased for both FY20, FY19 and FY18, although the rate of decrease has reduced over time.
* Free cash flow while still high is reducing over time and will continue to do so as LUMN are likely to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and paying off its long-term debt.
* Executive compensation (specifically focussing on CEO compensation) is above average for the industry at $17M (compared to an average of $10M for similar sizes). It is worth noting that when comparing against larger companies or those listed as competitors, this level of compensation was not unusual. Compensation did stabilise as performance dropped, however, no decrease in compensation occurred despite the decrease in earnings. While not initially a problem, if the results do not turn around, and there is no decrease in compensation, there is a concern that executive pay is no longer in line with the company’s results.

**Neutral Considerations**

* Long term credit rating (Moody’s) – Ba3: Speculative with substantial - high credit risk.
* Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings – SGL-2: Good liquidity, will be able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months through mostly internal resources but may rely on external sources of committed financing.
* Southeastern Asset Management has increased its position in $LUMN as of Dec 2020. It is worth noting that they have lost (\~25%) on the investment to date2. Despite this, they remain bullish on the overall prospects as the CEO has tightened controls on costs and margin improves. Additionally, they believe $LUMN can monetise several segments they are in (specifically fiber), and that as a multiple of free cash flow (< 5 at the time of investing) is an attractive valuation. As a final point, they have signed an NDA with $LUMN, and this indicates a higher and more “activist” level of engagement3. I have listed this as neutral despite the bullish sentiment of SAM, as their track record for the last year has not been great compared to the overall market.
* $LUMN will be seeing reduced subsidy revenue (from CAF II – A US initiative to improve connectivity) with subsidies declining to $20 by 2022. However, $LUMN believes their investment into providing this connectivity is likely to add to revenue that will make up for the loss in subsidy.

# Organisation Summary

Essentially Lumen Combine underlying infrastructure with platforms (i.e., cloud PaaS) and Applications (SaaS):

1. **Adaptive Networking** – High performance network connectivity i.e., on premise private lines, Content Delivery Network, fiber internet connectivity, direct cloud connections (where they provide corporate WAN infrastructure a direct link to Cloud) and managed networking services / consulting.

* Content delivery network market growth is forecast to grow at 14% till 20254.
* Fiber Internet connectivity in the US grew at 12% from 2019-202022 and will likely continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years. Across the EU growth rates are largely similar for both coverage growth and subscriber growth5.
* Software defined networking offerings (Networking as a service) is an expanding industry and likely to see significant growth of 34% annually till 20266.
* Growth rates and industry sizes for private lines and direct cloud connections are not easily available. I believe direct cloud connections are a growth area and likely to grow at a reasonable 10-15% annually for the next few years (based on over all cloud growth, increase in colocation and deployment of data centres – see Hybrid Cloud below).

1. **Collaboration** \- VOIP, teleconferencing, collaboration solutions (e.g., file sharing and virtual meeting rooms all hosted by Lumen, but the products can be from vendors like Zoom, Webex Skype etc.), contact centres and calling services (e.g., traditional phone style calling both locally and internationally as well as toll free / business numbers. Also advanced emergency services support).

* VOIP is relatively mature industry with a CAGR of 12% (at best) till 20257. Personally, I think we can discount any mobile VOIP growth as I do not believe LUMN has offerings in this space and in my view, this would lower the effective CAGR with 8-10% looking a more reasonable target.
* Call centre growth is forecast to grow at 6% till 20278. The US houses over 60% of call centres globally, and this number is only going to decrease as increased internet penetration and decreased telecom rates drive the outsourcing of call centres9.
* Numbers and growth rates to traditional telephony are limited but I imagine that growth is probably negative. For toll free, business numbers and emergency services support, growth is likely positive but limited.
* Collaboration solutions are growing at a reasonably high rate of 13% till 202710. However, LUMN is limited to managing, implementing, running, and hosting products from other vendors as they do not sell their own.

1. **Connected Security** – Threat management (managed threat intelligence), managed SOC services, WAF and DDoS mitigation, managed firewalls, and professional services.

* The WAF market is expected to grow at 18% annually till 202211.
* The DDoS mitigation market is set to grow at 15% annually till 202612.
* The managed security services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% till 202513. While I think managed firewall growth is likely to be less than other managed security services (e.g., IAM, SOC etc), a growth rate of 4-6% is probable.

1. Edge Computing – Managed services, connections to both public cloud and private data centres, networking, colocation, cloud. Essentially connecting edge locations / end user servers to backbone infrastructure.

* Edge computing as an industry is forecast to grow at \~25% annually till 202514. However, it is currently a small market valued at \~ $ 2,000 in 20201. Edge computing as a market can be further subdivided into hardware, platform, and services. Hardware is expected to grow at the fastest rate of the three potentially reaching 40%15.

1. **Hybrid Cloud** – Cloud storage, disaster recovery (data replication and business continuity), hosting services, data centres, private and public cloud alongside consulting for cloud.

* The private cloud market is expected to grow at 29% annually till 2025. Private cloud growth will primarily be driven by businesses who wish to take advantage of public cloud capability with the addition of potentially more secure and customisable hosting resources. On-premises cloud growth will be significantly lower than provider hosted options (PaaS / IaaS) which are likely to hit 50%16.
* Hosting services are likely to increase in market size by 15% annually17.
* Deployment of data centres are likely to increase slowly over the next few years with a growth rate not likely to exceed 10% (estimated at 6% for 202118). Similarly, colocation services are likely to see a modest 14% CAGR19.
* Global cloud storage is expected to increase at a rate of 20% till 202520.

# Competitive Advantage

1. **Adaptive Networking:**

* Summary: A large revenue earner with solid growth potential. $LUMN is a large player in the infrastructure space and should be able to leverage that to provide organisations with NaaS and global fiber connectivity.
* From a coverage perspective (compared to Verizon and AT&T as of 2019), $LUMN serves 16% of the population, with Verizon and AT&T serving 17% and 41% respectively. It is worth noting that $LUMN covers more states than either21, 22. N.B. this view is for consumers but presumably also can also be applied to corporate coverage.
* $LUMN is relatively well positioned from a fiber perspective as they have a lot of “unique coverage” (i.e., locations served without significant competition) in the US and have coverage in Europe and Asia. They carry a large portion of internet traffic on their network backbone and have 180,000 locations globally which provide their customers direct access to $LUMN infrastructure. Additionally, they have direct connectivity to several cloud service providers and data centres. Compared to competitors, they appear to have the largest total fiber route23.
* The software defined networking offerings are an exciting growth opportunity and combined with the strong infrastructure position of $LUMN will mean that customers (particularly those that are multinationals and large enterprises) can utilise the network as a service offering to connect their enterprise infrastructure efficiently and effectively across the globe including connections from on-premises to cloud service providers.
* While competitors do exist, from both a software defined networking perspective (e.g., Fortinet, Cato etc.) and an infrastructure perspective (e.g. Verizon, AT&T etc.) $LUMN has the advantage of being a strong player in both areas with good partnerships with Cisco and VMWare.

1. **Collaboration:**

* Summary: Largely a legacy business and revenue generator for $LUMN. This will be a shrinking revenue area for $LUMN as the decline in traditional legacy telephony services is unlikely to be made up for by any growth in VoIP or collaboration solutions. Additionally, this area is a large revenue earner for $LUMN, and significant declines here would result in material impact to value.
* While implementing and managing VoIP, teleconferencing and collaboration solutions with partnered vendors (e.g., Zoom) are likely to show some little to moderate growth over the coming years, they will likely provide consistent revenue due to the underlying network requirements needed to effectively utilise such solutions.
* Traditional telephony services including contact / service centres and business telephony service revenues are likely to shrink over the coming few years.

1. **Connected Security:**

* Summary: The cybersecurity market is an exciting growth area which holds significant potential for $LUMN. However, it remains a small % of overall revenues and so revenue growth in-line with industry expectation will not materially impact the overall value of $LUMN.
* If $LUMN can leverage their verticals in the datacentre / cloud space to cross sell their security services this could see some reasonably large growth, but overall due to the small footprint of $LUMN in the cloud space presently, material value growth due to this vertical is likely be several years out.
* Additionally, $LUMN is not a recognised global player in this industry unlike Akamai or NetScout, and so will be at a disadvantage compared to incumbents with higher profile portfolios.

1. **Edge Computing:**

* Summary: This could be a strong growth area for $LUMN. Could be a way to take advantage of the potentially significant growth area of Edge computing. However, it is likely to significantly materialise only 1-2 years out with little revenue growth in this area prior to then as organisations slowly accept this paradigm shift. Additionally, it will be a highly competitive area that will require significant investment to grow and maintain an advantage.
* As of 23 Feb 2021, $LUMN claims they provide 60% of enterprise locations with <5ms latency to edge nodes. Their goal is 90% by the end of the year and their large fiber network leaves them at an advantage compared to competitors. (See Adaptive Networking).
* An example from the 4Q20 earnings call was SAP using their Edge infrastructure to bring SaaS applications closer to customers and bypassing unnecessary internet traversal.
* While $LUMN can leverage its underlying infrastructure and assets to push a solid offering, this is likely to be a highly competitive space with players including typical cloud service providers e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and HPE as well as specialised players e.g. Mutable. Large cloud players will have both the hardware and software required to compete effectively with $LUMN while also being able to leverage their substantial public cloud technologies to gain an advantage.

1. **Hybrid Cloud:**

* Summary: If you are interested in taking advantage of private or public cloud growth then Lumen probably is not the best value even at its current multiple. This is due to low revenues (as a % of total revenues) from Cloud related activities. Additionally, this space is highly competitive and $LUMN does not appear to have the background or experience (it is working on growing its employee expertise) although they can potentially take advantage of their underlying infrastructure from their fiber and physical assets.
* Personally, I believe Private Cloud is not a significantly growing area with potentially some shorter term increase due to pandemic pushing a more remote working / access focus. However, longer term 3-5 years out, I think hybrid cloud will be the dominant focus as organisations transition from private cloud to increased public cloud usage. Only 3% of enterprises use private cloud exclusively24.
* If you are going to opt for growth within public cloud, there are higher growth options with AMZN, GOOG and MSFT although these are substantially higher in price. Alternatively, Cisco, HPE, or other smaller providers may work. A dedicated cloud provider will likely provide better value than $LUMN due to the low revenue share (see above).

1615574060.0,AAPL,"Ok guys I get it and I have been there when it comes to making this money with GME. I have been the guy who hits the refresh button all day, who GUH's the dips, of course I have in the past had to use credit because I had spent more of my paycheck  than I should have.  I have seen a lot of people who are getting  obsessive to the point its could be unhealthy. We are one of the most chilled out group of autists  I have ever met. Which is why I made this guide to remind you all of a few things. I based this guide off of posts I have seen and replies to posts I have made. Please note I am not speaking about 1 stock in general, this applies to everything market related. I just use GME because its an easy example. 

1. It's a good thing the market closes on the Weekend. This cannot be the only thing you focus on. As your parents or wife's boyfriend would tell you "" Go outside"". You need to get out and do other things not related to the stock market. Keep your hobbies, play with your kids, go see your parents. You have to get out and do things other than WSB,and watching tickers all day.
2. Eat you Autistic pieces of shit. 3 Meals a day I dont care if its all Wendys, you have to eat 3 meals a day. On a serious note either eat some fruit or take a good multi vitamin. For the sake of not spending all of Melvins money on doctors visits please drink some water too.  

3. DON'T SPEND MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE. If I see one more question about how margin works ,how to get approved for margin or if they should yolo all their money on Margin im going to have a stroke.  If you thought losing more than half your initial investment sucks, Imagine losing all you invested because you now owe your broker their portion. Then of course you might owe some interest on that pending on the broker.

&#x200B;

4. Dont let this get in the way of your day job. I cleared near half my yearly salary on GME round one. I did this all the while working and not neglecting my responsibilities. I dont care if you're a  bagger at the grocery store or the stim man Crazy Joe. Do your shit so you can pay your bills. If you really cannot help it take some PTO on a day that you think you will need to watch it constantly. Just dont get fired.

&#x200B;

5. Your family probably thinks its cool you're in on something big ( GME for example),but they probably get sick of hearing about it. This should not be the only dialog you have with others around you. Keep that shit here, lets circle jerk. Told the wife today Im back in GME for 3k more ( I have been trying to swing trade it for RD 2 just to do something different all the while catching the squeeze). All she said was "" again?"". Now in RD 1 she was asking about it probably as much as I was looking at it . This is not nearly as cool as many of us think it is. Most people dont get whats happening or do not care. This is ok.

6. Know when to get out. I know this is hard for people from my generation but in this game there are winners and losers. Dont be a fuckin loser you fucking loser. When this shit can change your life take some profit. Stay in diamond hand the shit out of it but take care of you. Someone during this squeeze will still buy at the top Guaranteed . He/she will HODL and be stuck at sub 10% loss for sure.  Get in before its too late or just say this is not for me this time. 

7. Now this is kinda misinformation because the market makes no sense right now but.... Once something reaches the news,social media ,or is being talked about. Its usually too late. BUY the rumor sell the news.Someone out there already knew this before the media did, they got in when it was low. Once its common knowledge these people or firms are already selling leaving you bag holding. 

8. Do your DD. No!! not the DD your wife's boyfriend is giving her while you cuck looking at AH tickers on your phone. Research the stock , and decide for yourself. Go to investopedia and educate yourself on the vocabulary. You should know some basics behind stock fundamentals. If Im pushing a stock on here , you do not know me. I could just be trying to give you my bags to hold. 

&#x200B;

9. Exercise please , you need to move about during your day. It will help you mentally and physically .

10.Dont hate on others who dont invest in your stock. We are a support group, a fundamental group and above all else we eat crayons together. I bought GME in January at 40$ per share, got told I was a retard for doing so by my friends. Never said shit to them when it mooned,even though they told me WMT is where the money is. Not everyone is in GME, and those who are genuinely believe the hype. As my wife's boyfriend says to be when I get to be a grumpy gills "" If you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all.""

11. To make it simple if you dont know how to buy a Call option don't be buying call options. You need to do a lot more research into the fundamentals. You will lose your ass.

1615573404.0,BLDR,"Builders FirstSource manufactures and supplies building materials, manufactured components, and construction services to professional homebuilders, sub-contractors, remodelers, and consumers in the United States. Basically they build to order construction elements like roof trusses, dormers, and cabinets to make the framing of a building much simpler, cheaper, and faster than if a builder was buying the lumber, looking and plans and doing all the framing themselves.

I like this stock and have been adding over the last 18 months.  It has a 5.5b market cap so within the thresholds of this forum. Why it is not a meme yet I do not know. The thing moves like NAIL with a beta of 2.58 while being wholly less likely to go up in smoke. 2020 was a huge year for them, the stock gained 146% yet still trades at just 17.75 P/E. It is currently trading near ATH making it both undervalued and a growth opportunity.

Honestly, I don’t know much about technical analysis so I’m just going to quote their CEO regarding Q4: “Revenue increased 3.6%, adjusted operating profit grew 22.8% and adjusted EBITDA increased 21.6%. Adjusted operating and EBITDA margins expanded 200 basis points and 240 basis points respectively, and adjusted net income increased 32.6% to $7.28 per diluted share.”

The stock is only around $47 a share with 206.5 million shares. There is currently unprecedented demand for residential new construction but all their sectors grew last year, including commercial construction.  Their earnings per share growth for Q4 2020 grew 237% over the same quarter of the prior year.

Cons: Volume is low, no one seems to know about it. Bid ask spreads fairly wide. Lumber prices are extremely high right now due to idiots who hoarded toilet paper and forest fires in the Northwest USA last year, I believe they can just pass this on to customers but could affect existing contacts. Related to beta, sometimes this can move a lot without an obvious catalyst (good IMO). It doesn’t get much coverage.

1615571742.0,AFRM,"I’m putting a price target of $145 on the shares, representing enormous opportunity from current levels ($79).  Here’s my thesis:  Affirm charges merchants -- including COVID-19 lockdown beneficiary Peloton -- to take on the risk of customers who want to pay with installments. Millennials are driving a change in the traditional idea of paying by credit, and investors now have a way to play that trend in the U. S. Affirm allows consumers to split purchases into installments. The company is modernizing the world of payments by offering an option to make purchases over time without incurring interest for consumers.

Affirm makes money on its ""0% APR"" installment options by taking a cut of the merchant end of the transaction. The idea is that merchants are willing to pay Affirm to conduct risk modeling and offer its service as a way to boost conversion to a sale. The 0% APR options generally nets the company its largest fees from merchants, though it also offers "" simple-interest"" loans through which it receives fixed interest payments on the consumer end as well.

Max Levchin co-founded Affirm in 2012. He has an impressive pedigree as one of PayPal’s co-founders. While everyone recognizes Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, you shouldn’t dismiss Levchin’s contribution – he is a powerhouse. We are impressed when someone creates an empire and helps revolutionize the way business is done. We have great faith in him as Affirm’s CEO.

Levchin is a disruptor and is changing the way people pay for goods and how they pay for them over time. Seeking to set the credit card world on its head, the company appeals to both consumers and merchants with a simple, attractive proposition. His vision for the company is to be as “ubiquitous, secure, and convenient as legacy networks, yet far more transparent, honest, and both consumer- and merchant-centric.”

The company is the online lender on the consumer front, and brings clarity on the amount owed and when it is due. A major portion of its business is helping merchants provide 0% financing, and it has signed up major companies like Priceline, Gucci, Dyson, and Expedia. The consumer-centric approach means the company doesn’t charge late fees and interest is not compounded. That is, it is simple interest. The company profits by treating its customers fairly, rather than by gouging them with high interest and unreasonable fees. Profitability is based on growing consumer acceptance, which in turn, makes it more valuable for merchants to offer. For merchants, the company is focused on helping them improve their brand, gain more customers, and increase sales. Affirm earns revenue from this source when it facilitates a sale and payment.

Affirm and Shopify struck an agreement in July through which Shopify would list Affirm as a payment option, giving the company exposure to Shopify's vast base of merchants. Affirm will pay Shopify a fee for each sale processed through its platform, and the company will be Shopify's exclusive partner for such payment options over the course of the arrangement, which lasts three years initially and then subsequently renews for additional one-year terms unless one party decides to discontinue the arrangement.

The company is past the proof-of-concept stage. There are over 6.2 million (!) consumers that have signed up, having completed over 17 million transactions, and the company works with over 6,500 merchants. Gross Merchandise Value\* (GMV) was $10.7 billion over the last three years. Last year, about 64% of its loans were made to repeat customers.

The company went public on January 13th at $49, pricing 25 million shares above the $41 to $44 range. There was strong demand for the IPO. Opening at $91, it reached $103 on the first day of trading. The following day, it went to $138.  Now the stock in trading in the 80s meaning you can get it for less than the IPO.

There is a long runway for continued strong revenue growth that will drive earnings improvement. This will continue fueling the stock.

# The New Normal (disruption)

Whether you're a believer in climate change or a denier of it, one thing we can all agree on is that extreme weather patterns  (by view of our short lifespans) are becoming more and more frequent, whether you think it's because that's just how things go or if cow farts are going to doom us all. Weather related damage to life, liberty, and the pursuit of tendies is now averaging 22 billion dollars a year in the United States absent of cost to infrastructure disruptions, with power disruption phenomena contributing to over 50,000 deaths per year.  As we continue to evolve and become more reliant upon technology, distributed data platforms, IoT, EVs, robot surgeons, etc., disruptions in access to power render us completely impotent to function as a society.

&#x200B;

# Our crumbling infrastructure:

&#x200B;

Thanks to the Boomers who have been wasting our immense wealth on blow, being able to see the pimples on Jenna Jameson's ass in 20 year old videos while they flaccidly beat off in their office, and in general fucking everything in this world up, the American Society of Civil Engineers has given our power grid infrastructure a D-minus grade.  Not only are there many single points of failure, the grid we presently have was only rated for 50 years of service, and a huge percentage of it is well beyond that expected lifespan.  Meanwhile, our consumption demands have increased exponentially and will continue to do so both as our population expands due to a combination of your wife's boyfriend continually getting her pregnant (or open border policies, whichever you believe in) as well as our fucked up attempts to become the Jetsons.  These are streams that should not be crossed, but we're doing it anyways because we're in the early stages of the Idiocracy documentary.

&#x200B;

# Enter $BE.  So what do these guys do?  The 3 R's:  Resiliency, Redundancy, and Retardedness

First, let's get one thing out of the way:  These guys are NOT primarily a play on replacing municipal infrastructure with green energy like solar or wind farms for large capacity energy production.  That's a crowded space, and they'd be a bad competitor there.  What they are a play on is providing MICROGRIDS for critical infrastructure to ensure continuous power delivery to essential services.  Their product provides RESILIENCY and REDUNDANCY to individual campuses and facilities to ensure that, even in the absolute worst case scenario, the wheels keep turning at vulnerable locales.  Think hospitals, water treatment facilities, nursing homes, airports, etc. at the lower level of Maslow's hierarchy and data centers, shipping hubs and the CEO's 7th vacation villa at the corporate level.  The things that will grind something to a screeching halt in the event of power failure.  The 3rd R is just a reminder that, if you're reading this, you're retarded.  Just thought you might need a reminder.

&#x200B;

# OK, HOW do they do it?  What makes them special/different?  Elon says solar and batteries are the futurez, man

&#x200B;

$BE is different than most green energy plays in that they make solid oxide fuel cells they call servers that will convert fuel (usually hydrogen, but they can run on RNG or ethanol, as well) to electricity WITHOUT combustion (that's the big differentiator here).  I won't get too sciency here because you smooth brains wouldn't get it, but it's got electrolytes, and that's what plants crave, bitches.  They require no precious metals (so no shortage concerns).  Each ""server"", which runs about 3/4 of a million dollars a unit, produces 250 kw of juice and can power 1 30,000 square foot commercial space or up to 100 homes.  These servers produce energy at 55% efficiency (for point of comparison, solar is 12%).  They do produce CO2 as waste, but only half as much as natural gas power stations.  When using RNG as the fuel source, they are a net-zero carbon emission product, which is good both for government spending programs to appease the Sierra Club as well as carbon tax dodging companies.  They're also presently burning all their positive cash flow into figuring out how to harness the CO2 these produce to turn it into some other form of energy, which would make them a CARBON NEGATIVE product if they pull it off.  That's Star Trek shit right there. These servers pay for themselves in an average of 3-5 years, making them an attractive long-term investment, especially against the 17 years it takes for solar to pay for itself.

&#x200B;

Most importantly, they operate completely independently of a power grid and are not subject to adverse weather impacting their functionality (like a solar panel getting covered with snow or temperatures falling so low that nat gas plants and windmills freeze), guaranteeing reliable access to power.  Elon's mega batteries are still constrained by the limitation that power needs to be injected into the batteries and those batteries can be drained.  These fuel cells will always operate and never run out of juice barring a component failure.

&#x200B;

**All of this is important because it highlights the fact that $BE has no real competitors on the market for the niche they've filled, and aren't going to be hampered by price increases/hunting for lithium, rare earth metals, chip shortages, etc.  The only comparable company out there is Ballard Power Systems, who is focused more on buses, industrial machinery, trains, etc., not infrastructure.   Ballard is trying to fight in the battery space, which is very crowded.**

# Fuck you, Mr. Wizard - TENDIES, fucker!

&#x200B;

Alright, alright, alright.  Chill the fuck out.  I'm sorry your wife didn't peg you last night and now you're surly.  These dudes are gonna make money 4 ways:

&#x200B;

* 1 is the human life aspect.  Loss of life is tragic, but let's be honest:  Mostly, it's just bad optics if you're a politician, and what happened in Texas and California threatens political job security.    If they can spend YOUR money to ensure that they can keep TAKING money from you, they're gonna be all ears.  Expect a lot of regulation in the coming years mandating that essential facilities have access to reliable off-grid power in the case of natural disaster, Hungarian hackers or Chinese invaders.  And we can't just have Becky from HR run out to the Generac every 20 minutes to fill it with gas from the Exxon station down the street.  Interns won't blow you if you're working at Wendy's after getting voted out. The fact that it will save lives is just a nice bonus
* 2 is corporate greed.  It's bad for business to be ground to a halt, and corporations know they can't rely on the government to give them juice.  Most of $BE's money thus far (we'll get to that in a moment) already comes from corporate America.  Companies like $EBAY,  $HD, $WMT, $INTC, $AAPL, $GOOGL, $ORCL, etc. already use these guys to ensure that their data centers and shipping depots are always powered on and operational because just because the apocalypse is here doesn't mean you stop making money.   Secretaries won't blow you in the executive washroom if the board fires you.
* The 3rd is as an add-on to replacements to our current grid infrastructure to harden it and provide insurance against limited disruptions.  Customers  won't blow you if their nipples are frozen.
* The 4th is a future product, but as they hone their product and reduce their cost of production, adding a small consumer grade sized server to your home could provide about 1kW of power at a cost of about 3 grand, making it a favorable alternative to a generator or a Tesla wall paired with solar panels.  Your wife won't blow you if....well, let's be honest, she just won't blow you.  Sorry.

# Under the hood:  Financials:

&#x200B;

At the time of this writing, $BE is trading at $27.14 with a market cap of 5 billion dollars.  Their 52 week high was $45, and their 52 week low was all the way down at $3.  They were recently dragged down in the broader market correction on the NASDAQ because, even though they're an energy sector play and thus shouldn't have been hit as hard, they're ""tech energy"", so they got pulled down unfairly (right along with last week's DD, $CLNE - you're welcome on that, btw).  Even th ough they have a gross margin of over 25%, they are not a profitable company because they put all of their money into R&D.  They do about a billion dollars in revenue annually and are looking at a growth rate of over 420% in the next 2 years (no, I didn't randomly pick that number off the top of my head, that's where the math leads.  It's a sign, bitches).

&#x200B;

If we look at total returns with companies $BE gets lumped in with, we see that they severely lagged in terms of return during this green energy boom:

&#x200B;

Now, there are 2 ways you can look at this:  You can be the bad kind of retarded and say it's a bad investment because  some of these other plays have performed better, or you can be the good kind of retarded and realize that these other plays that outperformed were all in the BATTERY space and that Bloom was overlooked because it plays in infrastructure, and now gets to CATCH UP to the rest of these guys that are already very crowded trades, making you a fuck ton of money.  You want to throw money in something that's already fully vested, or something that's ""got next""?

What's the smart money doing?  Let's take a look at the short interest:

&#x200B;

The smart money is getting the fuck out of the way because they know this thing is coiling and is gonna bust a nut all over their faces if they don't.

&#x200B;

Normalizing all of their numbers, the price target for this stonk was trending along nicely till the broader market correction the last few weeks.  And these targets were before a light got shone on how shitty our power reliability is

&#x200B;

# Technical Teabagging:

Looking at the technicals, we see a few things.  First, on the daily it's not the smoothest price action, but we had a nice upwards channel up until the correction, and it's since gone into a descending wedge with a strong bull flag to the upside.  Now if you're looking at this and thinking to yourself ""self, this looks like a very traditional head and shoulders pattern and we've formed the right neckline"", you would be correct looking at the chart blind, but in so doing you would be ignoring the larger market correction that caused the beginning of that pattern to form, which means it'll probably be a broken H&S.  Again, these lines aren't great because I'm too lazy - I usually just eyeball it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Expanding out to a 2 hour 20 day, things get cleaner.  Your light blue line is the 20 day moving average, the dark blue is the 50 day SMA, and the cream line is the 200 SMA.  Descending resistance, ascending support.  It's nearing the end of its coil for a breakout.  The 20 day and 50 MA will very likely be crossing in the near future at that $34 mark.

&#x200B;

# So, to summarize:

&#x200B;

* $BE has a lot of tailwinds at its back as the result of the recent infrastructure debacles and the calls for regulation and upgrades to infrastructure, which will only become more frequent as time progresses
* With a 3-5 year return on investment, these products present an attractive investment to corporations looking to both hedge their bets against corporate incompetence as well as reduce their exposure to carbon tax measures
* Because their products don't go into EV's and aren't working with supervillains trying to get people to buy joke currency, they were largely left behind in the recent surge in green energy valuations because people largely didn't understand their voodoo or that these guys even existed, but social awareness of them is raising.  Leaving them a lot of room to the upside to run
* Even though they should have been immune to the broader market selloff as an energy sector play (the energy stonks actually went up during that correction), they got unfairly dragged down because they're still sort of a tech play.  This creates an interesting and attractive buying opportunity, even if this stonk has run a bit since I started touting it in the dailies (as I only do one DD a week, you've missed the absolute bottom, but this is free so fuck you if you want to complain)
* They're definitely going to be getting some of that gubmit corporate stimmy money to shut AOC up.
* Microgrids to critical operations such as hospitals, nursing homes, water treatment facilities, etc. are going to become a big thing and very likely an architectural standard in the future
* **They have zero competition in the space they reside in, which is really fucking unusual**
* There's a long play here by which these things could be attractive power assurance features to new home builds or as retrofits, particularly in parts of the country where natural disasters and adverse weather frequently affect access to electricity
* They're immune to weather phenomena (and actually operate better in colder weather), making them an attractive power resiliency option

&#x200B;

# Price Targets:

&#x200B;

As I've said multiple times, this stonk was positively FLYING as it caught up to $PLUG, $FCEL, etc. in the sector as people became more aware of it as a value play.  Couple that with the tailwinds it now has as a result of a shitty winter and never ending California wildfires.  A short term price target of $32 by mid April is a bet I'd have 70% conviction on.  Barring continued market manipulation because of Boomer bonds, 45-50 by mid summer, and a long term price target (given their growth projections) of $72 are entirely within reach.

&#x200B;

# How do you play it?:

&#x200B;

You can actually FD this one, if you really want to.  This thing has a very standard behavior:  It tends to pop at the open and then fades into the day.  Further, if you time that coil right, you can experience a really nice breakout on a weekly.  Personally, I like the 5/21 32cs at anything under $4 and I was buying the shit out of them during the correction, but that's just because my brain still has like 3 wrinkles in it that I can't seem to iron out.

&#x200B;

One thing to note is this is not a high volume stonk.  Only about 35000 shares will trade hands near the open, and options interest is low enough to where if you're playing with a big bankroll, filling a large order will take time.  As such, the spreads tend to be pretty wide on this guy, so you're going to want to manually enter something that's 10 cents above the current offer price and babysit it till its filled.

&#x200B;

# Position Disclaimers:

&#x200B;

I'm balls deep in these guys, and have been since early November of last year when I purchased most of the shares my VC had from funding them a decade ago to my personal accounts as we shifted the nature of our portfolio.  Since that time, I've only added to my positions on the options chain.

&#x200B;

* 263,800 shares @ $14
* 2000 5/21 32c's at an average cost basis of 2.60
* 1000 1/22 60c's at 3 even
* 500 1/22 65c's at 2.70

I'd like to say my position is fully vested, but I've been buying every single fucking dip on this one.

# The New Normal (disruption)

Whether you're a believer in climate change or a denier of it, one thing we can all agree on is that extreme weather patterns  (by view of our short lifespans) are becoming more and more frequent, whether you think it's because that's just how things go or if cow farts are going to doom us all. Weather related damage to life, liberty, and the pursuit of tendies is now averaging 22 billion dollars a year in the United States absent of cost to infrastructure disruptions, with power disruption phenomena contributing to over 50,000 deaths per year.  As we continue to evolve and become more reliant upon technology, distributed data platforms, IoT, EVs, robot surgeons, etc., disruptions in access to power render us completely impotent to function as a society.

&#x200B;

# Our crumbling infrastructure:

&#x200B;

Thanks to the Boomers who have been wasting our immense wealth on blow, being able to see the pimples on Jenna Jameson's ass in 20 year old videos while they flaccidly beat off in their office, and in general fucking everything in this world up, the American Society of Civil Engineers has given our power grid infrastructure a D-minus grade.  Not only are there many single points of failure, the grid we presently have was only rated for 50 years of service, and a huge percentage of it is well beyond that expected lifespan.  Meanwhile, our consumption demands have increased exponentially and will continue to do so both as our population expands due to a combination of your wife's boyfriend continually getting her pregnant (or open border policies, whichever you believe in) as well as our fucked up attempts to become the Jetsons.  These are streams that should not be crossed, but we're doing it anyways because we're in the early stages of the Idiocracy documentary.

&#x200B;

# Enter $BE.  So what do these guys do?  The 3 R's:  Resiliency, Redundancy, and Retardedness

First, let's get one thing out of the way:  These guys are NOT primarily a play on replacing municipal infrastructure with green energy like solar or wind farms for large capacity energy production.  That's a crowded space, and they'd be a bad competitor there.  What they are a play on is providing MICROGRIDS for critical infrastructure to ensure continuous power delivery to essential services.  Their product provides RESILIENCY and REDUNDANCY to individual campuses and facilities to ensure that, even in the absolute worst case scenario, the wheels keep turning at vulnerable locales.  Think hospitals, water treatment facilities, nursing homes, airports, etc. at the lower level of Maslow's hierarchy and data centers, shipping hubs and the CEO's 7th vacation villa at the corporate level.  The things that will grind something to a screeching halt in the event of power failure.  The 3rd R is just a reminder that, if you're reading this, you're retarded.  Just thought you might need a reminder.

&#x200B;

# OK, HOW do they do it?  What makes them special/different?  Elon says solar and batteries are the futurez, man

&#x200B;

$BE is different than most green energy plays in that they make solid oxide fuel cells they call servers that will convert fuel (usually hydrogen, but they can run on RNG or ethanol, as well) to electricity WITHOUT combustion (that's the big differentiator here).  I won't get too sciency here because you smooth brains wouldn't get it, but it's got electrolytes, and that's what plants crave, bitches.  They require no precious metals (so no shortage concerns).  Each ""server"", which runs about 3/4 of a million dollars a unit, produces 250 kw of juice and can power 1 30,000 square foot commercial space or up to 100 homes.  These servers produce energy at 55% efficiency (for point of comparison, solar is 12%).  They do produce CO2 as waste, but only half as much as natural gas power stations.  When using RNG as the fuel source, they are a net-zero carbon emission product, which is good both for government spending programs to appease the Sierra Club as well as carbon tax dodging companies.  They're also presently burning all their positive cash flow into figuring out how to harness the CO2 these produce to turn it into some other form of energy, which would make them a CARBON NEGATIVE product if they pull it off.  That's Star Trek shit right there. These servers pay for themselves in an average of 3-5 years, making them an attractive long-term investment, especially against the 17 years it takes for solar to pay for itself.

&#x200B;

Most importantly, they operate completely independently of a power grid and are not subject to adverse weather impacting their functionality (like a solar panel getting covered with snow or temperatures falling so low that nat gas plants and windmills freeze), guaranteeing reliable access to power.  Elon's mega batteries are still constrained by the limitation that power needs to be injected into the batteries and those batteries can be drained.  These fuel cells will always operate and never run out of juice barring a component failure.

&#x200B;

**All of this is important because it highlights the fact that $BE has no real competitors on the market for the niche they've filled, and aren't going to be hampered by price increases/hunting for lithium, rare earth metals, chip shortages, etc.  The only comparable company out there is Ballard Power Systems, who is focused more on buses, industrial machinery, trains, etc., not infrastructure.   Ballard is trying to fight in the battery space, which is very crowded.**

&#x200B;

# Fuck you, Mr. Wizard - TENDIES, fucker!

&#x200B;

Alright, alright, alright.  Chill the fuck out.  I'm sorry your wife didn't peg you last night and now you're surly.  These dudes are gonna make money 4 ways:

&#x200B;

* 1 is the human life aspect.  Loss of life is tragic, but let's be honest:  Mostly, it's just bad optics if you're a politician, and what happened in Texas and California threatens political job security.    If they can spend YOUR money to ensure that they can keep TAKING money from you, they're gonna be all ears.  Expect a lot of regulation in the coming years mandating that essential facilities have access to reliable off-grid power in the case of natural disaster, Hungarian hackers or Chinese invaders.  And we can't just have Becky from HR run out to the Generac every 20 minutes to fill it with gas from the Exxon station down the street.  Interns won't blow you if you're working at Wendy's after getting voted out. The fact that it will save lives is just a nice bonus
* 2 is corporate greed.  It's bad for business to be ground to a halt, and corporations know they can't rely on the government to give them juice.  Most of $BE's money thus far (we'll get to that in a moment) already comes from corporate America.  Companies like $EBAY,  $HD, $WMT, $INTC, $AAPL, $GOOGL, $ORCL, etc. already use these guys to ensure that their data centers and shipping depots are always powered on and operational because just because the apocalypse is here doesn't mean you stop making money.   Secretaries won't blow you in the executive washroom if the board fires you.
* The 3rd is as an add-on to replacements to our current grid infrastructure to harden it and provide insurance against limited disruptions.  Customers  won't blow you if their nipples are frozen.
* The 4th is a future product, but as they hone their product and reduce their cost of production, adding a small consumer grade sized server to your home could provide about 1kW of power at a cost of about 3 grand, making it a favorable alternative to a generator or a Tesla wall paired with solar panels.  Your wife won't blow you if....well, let's be honest, she just won't blow you.  Sorry.

# OK, HOW do they do it?  What makes them special/different?  Elon says solar and batteries are the futurez, man

&#x200B;

$BE is different than most green energy plays in that they make solid oxide fuel cells they call servers that will convert fuel (usually hydrogen, but they can run on RNG or ethanol, as well) to electricity WITHOUT combustion (that's the big differentiator here).  I won't get too sciency here because you smooth brains wouldn't get it, but it's got electrolytes, and that's what plants crave, bitches.  They require no precious metals (so no shortage concerns).  Each ""server"", which runs about 3/4 of a million dollars a unit, produces 250 kw of juice and can power 1 30,000 square foot commercial space or up to 100 homes.  These servers produce energy at 55% efficiency (for point of comparison, solar is 12%).  They do produce CO2 as waste, but only half as much as natural gas power stations.  When using RNG as the fuel source, they are a net-zero carbon emission product, which is good both for government spending programs to appease the Sierra Club as well as carbon tax dodging companies.  They're also presently burning all their positive cash flow into figuring out how to harness the CO2 these produce to turn it into some other form of energy, which would make them a CARBON NEGATIVE product if they pull it off.  That's Star Trek shit right there. These servers pay for themselves in an average of 3-5 years, making them an attractive long-term investment, especially against the 17 years it takes for solar to pay for itself.

&#x200B;

Most importantly, they operate completely independently of a power grid and are not subject to adverse weather impacting their functionality (like a solar panel getting covered with snow or temperatures falling so low that nat gas plants and windmills freeze), guaranteeing reliable access to power.  Elon's mega batteries are still constrained by the limitation that power needs to be injected into the batteries and those batteries can be drained.  These fuel cells will always operate and never run out of juice barring a component failure.

&#x200B;

**All of this is important because it highlights the fact that $BE has no real competitors on the market for the niche they've filled, and aren't going to be hampered by price increases/hunting for lithium, rare earth metals, chip shortages, etc.  The only comparable company out there is Ballard Power Systems, who is focused more on buses, industrial machinery, trains, etc., not infrastructure.   Ballard is trying to fight in the battery space, which is very crowded.**

# Fuck you, Mr. Wizard - TENDIES, fucker!

&#x200B;

Alright, alright, alright.  Chill the fuck out.  I'm sorry your wife didn't peg you last night and now you're surly.  These dudes are gonna make money 4 ways:

&#x200B;

* 1 is the human life aspect.  Loss of life is tragic, but let's be honest:  Mostly, it's just bad optics if you're a politician, and what happened in Texas and California threatens political job security.    If they can spend YOUR money to ensure that they can keep TAKING money from you, they're gonna be all ears.  Expect a lot of regulation in the coming years mandating that essential facilities have access to reliable off-grid power in the case of natural disaster, Hungarian hackers or Chinese invaders.  And we can't just have Becky from HR run out to the Generac every 20 minutes to fill it with gas from the Exxon station down the street.  Interns won't blow you if you're working at Wendy's after getting voted out. The fact that it will save lives is just a nice bonus
* 2 is corporate greed.  It's bad for business to be ground to a halt, and corporations know they can't rely on the government to give them juice.  Most of $BE's money thus far (we'll get to that in a moment) already comes from corporate America.  Companies like $EBAY,  $HD, $WMT, $INTC, $AAPL, $GOOGL, $ORCL, etc. already use these guys to ensure that their data centers and shipping depots are always powered on and operational because just because the apocalypse is here doesn't mean you stop making money.   Secretaries won't blow you in the executive washroom if the board fires you.
* The 3rd is as an add-on to replacements to our current grid infrastructure to harden it and provide insurance against limited disruptions.  Customers  won't blow you if their nipples are frozen.
* The 4th is a future product, but as they hone their product and reduce their cost of production, adding a small consumer grade sized server to your home could provide about 1kW of power at a cost of about 3 grand, making it a favorable alternative to a generator or a Tesla wall paired with solar panels.  Your wife won't blow you if....well, let's be honest, she just won't blow you.  Sorry.

# Under the hood:  Financials:

&#x200B;

At the time of this writing, $BE is trading at $27.14 with a market cap of 5 billion dollars.  Their 52 week high was $45, and their 52 week low was all the way down at $3.  They were recently dragged down in the broader market correction on the NASDAQ because, even though they're an energy sector play and thus shouldn't have been hit as hard, they're ""tech energy"", so they got pulled down unfairly (right along with last week's DD, $CLNE - you're welcome on that, btw).  Even th ough they have a gross margin of over 25%, they are not a profitable company because they put all of their money into R&D.  They do about a billion dollars in revenue annually and are looking at a growth rate of over 420% in the next 2 years (no, I didn't randomly pick that number off the top of my head, that's where the math leads.  It's a sign, bitches).

&#x200B;

If we look at total returns with companies $BE gets lumped in with, we see that they severely lagged in terms of return during this green energy boom:

&#x200B;

Now, there are 2 ways you can look at this:  You can be the bad kind of retarded and say it's a bad investment because  some of these other plays have performed better, or you can be the good kind of retarded and realize that these other plays that outperformed were all in the BATTERY space and that Bloom was overlooked because it plays in infrastructure, and now gets to CATCH UP to the rest of these guys that are already very crowded trades, making you a fuck ton of money.  You want to throw money in something that's already fully vested, or something that's ""got next""?

What's the smart money doing?  Let's take a look at the short interest:

&#x200B;

The smart money is getting the fuck out of the way because they know this thing is coiling and is gonna bust a nut all over their faces if they don't.

&#x200B;

Normalizing all of their numbers, the price target for this stonk was trending along nicely till the broader market correction the last few weeks.  And these targets were before a light got shone on how shitty our power reliability is

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Technical Teabagging:

Looking at the technicals, we see a few things.  First, on the daily it's not the smoothest price action, but we had a nice upwards channel up until the correction, and it's since gone into a descending wedge with a strong bull flag to the upside.  Now if you're looking at this and thinking to yourself ""self, this looks like a very traditional head and shoulders pattern and we've formed the right neckline"", you would be correct looking at the chart blind, but in so doing you would be ignoring the larger market correction that caused the beginning of that pattern to form, which means it'll probably be a broken H&S.  Again, these lines aren't great because I'm too lazy - I usually just eyeball it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Expanding out to a 2 hour 20 day, things get cleaner.  Your light blue line is the 20 day moving average, the dark blue is the 50 day SMA, and the cream line is the 200 SMA.  Descending resistance, ascending support.  It's nearing the end of its coil for a breakout.  The 20 day and 50 MA will very likely be crossing in the near future at that $34 mark.

&#x200B;

# So, to summarize:

&#x200B;

* $BE has a lot of tailwinds at its back as the result of the recent infrastructure debacles and the calls for regulation and upgrades to infrastructure, which will only become more frequent as time progresses
* With a 3-5 year return on investment, these products present an attractive investment to corporations looking to both hedge their bets against corporate incompetence as well as reduce their exposure to carbon tax measures
* Because their products don't go into EV's and aren't working with supervillains trying to get people to buy joke currency, they were largely left behind in the recent surge in green energy valuations because people largely didn't understand their voodoo or that these guys even existed, but social awareness of them is raising.  Leaving them a lot of room to the upside to run
* Even though they should have been immune to the broader market selloff as an energy sector play (the energy stonks actually went up during that correction), they got unfairly dragged down because they're still sort of a tech play.  This creates an interesting and attractive buying opportunity, even if this stonk has run a bit since I started touting it in the dailies (as I only do one DD a week, you've missed the absolute bottom, but this is free so fuck you if you want to complain)
* They're definitely going to be getting some of that gubmit corporate stimmy money to shut AOC up.
* Microgrids to critical operations such as hospitals, nursing homes, water treatment facilities, etc. are going to become a big thing and very likely an architectural standard in the future
* **They have zero competition in the space they reside in, which is really fucking unusual**
* There's a long play here by which these things could be attractive power assurance features to new home builds or as retrofits, particularly in parts of the country where natural disasters and adverse weather frequently affect access to electricity
* They're immune to weather phenomena (and actually operate better in colder weather), making them an attractive power resiliency option

&#x200B;

# Price Targets:

&#x200B;

As I've said multiple times, this stonk was positively FLYING as it caught up to $PLUG, $FCEL, etc. in the sector as people became more aware of it as a value play.  Couple that with the tailwinds it now has as a result of a shitty winter and never ending California wildfires.  A short term price target of $32 by mid April is a bet I'd have 70% conviction on.  Barring continued market manipulation because of Boomer bonds, 45-50 by mid summer, and a long term price target (given their growth projections) of $72 are entirely within reach.

&#x200B;

# How do you play it?:

&#x200B;

You can actually FD this one, if you really want to.  This thing has a very standard behavior:  It tends to pop at the open and then fades into the day.  Further, if you time that coil right, you can experience a really nice breakout on a weekly.  Personally, I like the 5/21 32cs at anything under $4 and I was buying the shit out of them during the correction, but that's just because my brain still has like 3 wrinkles in it that I can't seem to iron out.

&#x200B;

One thing to note is this is not a high volume stonk.  Only about 35000 shares will trade hands near the open, and options interest is low enough to where if you're playing with a big bankroll, filling a large order will take time.  As such, the spreads tend to be pretty wide on this guy, so you're going to want to manually enter something that's 10 cents above the current offer price and babysit it till its filled.

&#x200B;

# Position Disclaimers:

&#x200B;

I'm balls deep in these guys, and have been since early November of last year when I purchased most of the shares my VC had from funding them a decade ago to my personal accounts as we shifted the nature of our portfolio.  Since that time, I've only added to my positions on the options chain.

&#x200B;

* 263,800 shares @ $14
* 2000 5/21 32c's at an average cost basis of 2.60
* 1000 1/22 60c's at 3 even
* 500 1/22 65c's at 2.70

I'd like to say my position is fully vested, but I've been buying every single fucking dip on this one.

# The New Normal (disruption)

Whether you're a believer in climate change or a denier of it, one thing we can all agree on is that extreme weather patterns  (by view of our short lifespans) are becoming more and more frequent, whether you think it's because that's just how things go or if cow farts are going to doom us all. Weather related damage to life, liberty, and the pursuit of tendies is now averaging 22 billion dollars a year in the United States absent of cost to infrastructure disruptions, with power disruption phenomena contributing to over 50,000 deaths per year.  As we continue to evolve and become more reliant upon technology, distributed data platforms, IoT, EVs, robot surgeons, etc., disruptions in access to power render us completely impotent to function as a society.

&#x200B;

# Our crumbling infrastructure:

&#x200B;

Thanks to the Boomers who have been wasting our immense wealth on blow, being able to see the pimples on Jenna Jameson's ass in 20 year old videos while they flaccidly beat off in their office, and in general fucking everything in this world up, the American Society of Civil Engineers has given our power grid infrastructure a D-minus grade.  Not only are there many single points of failure, the grid we presently have was only rated for 50 years of service, and a huge percentage of it is well beyond that expected lifespan.  Meanwhile, our consumption demands have increased exponentially and will continue to do so both as our population expands due to a combination of your wife's boyfriend continually getting her pregnant (or open border policies, whichever you believe in) as well as our fucked up attempts to become the Jetsons.  These are streams that should not be crossed, but we're doing it anyways because we're in the early stages of the Idiocracy documentary.

&#x200B;

# Enter $BE.  So what do these guys do?  The 3 R's:  Resiliency, Redundancy, and Retardedness

First, let's get one thing out of the way:  These guys are NOT primarily a play on replacing municipal infrastructure with green energy like solar or wind farms for large capacity energy production.  That's a crowded space, and they'd be a bad competitor there.  What they are a play on is providing MICROGRIDS for critical infrastructure to ensure continuous power delivery to essential services.  Their product provides RESILIENCY and REDUNDANCY to individual campuses and facilities to ensure that, even in the absolute worst case scenario, the wheels keep turning at vulnerable locales.  Think hospitals, water treatment facilities, nursing homes, airports, etc. at the lower level of Maslow's hierarchy and data centers, shipping hubs and the CEO's 7th vacation villa at the corporate level.  The things that will grind something to a screeching halt in the event of power failure.  The 3rd R is just a reminder that, if you're reading this, you're retarded.  Just thought you might need a reminder.

I'm balls deep in these guys, and have been since early November of last year when I purchased most of the shares my VC had from funding them a decade ago to my personal accounts as we shifted the nature of our portfolio.  Since that time, I've only added to my positions on the options chain.

&#x200B;

* 263,800 shares @ $14
* 2000 5/21 32c's at an average cost basis of 2.60
* 1000 1/22 60c's at 3 even
* 500 1/22 65c's at 2.70

I'd like to say my position is fully vested, but I've been buying every single fucking dip on this one.

# The New Normal (disruption)

Whether you're a believer in climate change or a denier of it, one thing we can all agree on is that extreme weather patterns  (by view of our short lifespans) are becoming more and more frequent, whether you think it's because that's just how things go or if cow farts are going to doom us all. Weather related damage to life, liberty, and the pursuit of tendies is now averaging 22 billion dollars a year in the United States absent of cost to infrastructure disruptions, with power disruption phenomena contributing to over 50,000 deaths per year.  As we continue to evolve and become more reliant upon technology, distributed data platforms, IoT, EVs, robot surgeons, etc., disruptions in access to power render us completely impotent to function as a society.

&#x200B;

# Our crumbling infrastructure:

&#x200B;

Thanks to the Boomers who have been wasting our immense wealth on blow, being able to see the pimples on Jenna Jameson's ass in 20 year old videos while they flaccidly beat off in their office, and in general fucking everything in this world up, the American Society of Civil Engineers has given our power grid infrastructure a D-minus grade.  Not only are there many single points of failure, the grid we presently have was only rated for 50 years of service, and a huge percentage of it is well beyond that expected lifespan.  Meanwhile, our consumption demands have increased exponentially and will continue to do so both as our population expands due to a combination of your wife's boyfriend continually getting her pregnant (or open border policies, whichever you believe in) as well as our fucked up attempts to become the Jetsons.  These are streams that should not be crossed, but we're doing it anyways because we're in the early stages of the Idiocracy documentary.

&#x200B;

# Enter $BE.  So what do these guys do?  The 3 R's:  Resiliency, Redundancy, and Retardedness

First, let's get one thing out of the way:  These guys are NOT primarily a play on replacing municipal infrastructure with green energy like solar or wind farms for large capacity energy production.  That's a crowded space, and they'd be a bad competitor there.  What they are a play on is providing MICROGRIDS for critical infrastructure to ensure continuous power delivery to essential services.  Their product provides RESILIENCY and REDUNDANCY to individual campuses and facilities to ensure that, even in the absolute worst case scenario, the wheels keep turning at vulnerable locales.  Think hospitals, water treatment facilities, nursing homes, airports, etc. at the lower level of Maslow's hierarchy and data centers, shipping hubs and the CEO's 7th vacation villa at the corporate level.  The things that will grind something to a screeching halt in the event of power failure.  The 3rd R is just a reminder that, if you're reading this, you're retarded.  Just thought you might need a reminder.

&#x200B;

# OK, HOW do they do it?  What makes them special/different?  Elon says solar and batteries are the futurez, man

&#x200B;

$BE is different than most green energy plays in that they make solid oxide fuel cells they call servers that will convert fuel (usually hydrogen, but they can run on RNG or ethanol, as well) to electricity WITHOUT combustion (that's the big differentiator here).  I won't get too sciency here because you smooth brains wouldn't get it, but it's got electrolytes, and that's what plants crave, bitches.  They require no precious metals (so no shortage concerns).  Each ""server"", which runs about 3/4 of a million dollars a unit, produces 250 kw of juice and can power 1 30,000 square foot commercial space or up to 100 homes.  These servers produce energy at 55% efficiency (for point of comparison, solar is 12%).  They do produce CO2 as waste, but only half as much as natural gas power stations.  When using RNG as the fuel source, they are a net-zero carbon emission product, which is good both for government spending programs to appease the Sierra Club as well as carbon tax dodging companies.  They're also presently burning all their positive cash flow into figuring out how to harness the CO2 these produce to turn it into some other form of energy, which would make them a CARBON NEGATIVE product if they pull it off.  That's Star Trek shit right there. These servers pay for themselves in an average of 3-5 years, making them an attractive long-term investment, especially against the 17 years it takes for solar to pay for itself.

&#x200B;

Most importantly, they operate completely independently of a power grid and are not subject to adverse weather impacting their functionality (like a solar panel getting covered with snow or temperatures falling so low that nat gas plants and windmills freeze), guaranteeing reliable access to power.  Elon's mega batteries are still constrained by the limitation that power needs to be injected into the batteries and those batteries can be drained.  These fuel cells will always operate and never run out of juice barring a component failure.

&#x200B;

**All of this is important because it highlights the fact that $BE has no real competitors on the market for the niche they've filled, and aren't going to be hampered by price increases/hunting for lithium, rare earth metals, chip shortages, etc.  The only comparable company out there is Ballard Power Systems, who is focused more on buses, industrial machinery, trains, etc., not infrastructure.   Ballard is trying to fight in the battery space, which is very crowded.**

&#x200B;

# Fuck you, Mr. Wizard - TENDIES, fucker!

&#x200B;

Alright, alright, alright.  Chill the fuck out.  I'm sorry your wife didn't peg you last night and now you're surly.  These dudes are gonna make money 4 ways:

&#x200B;

* 1 is the human life aspect.  Loss of life is tragic, but let's be honest:  Mostly, it's just bad optics if you're a politician, and what happened in Texas and California threatens political job security.    If they can spend YOUR money to ensure that they can keep TAKING money from you, they're gonna be all ears.  Expect a lot of regulation in the coming years mandating that essential facilities have access to reliable off-grid power in the case of natural disaster, Hungarian hackers or Chinese invaders.  And we can't just have Becky from HR run out to the Generac every 20 minutes to fill it with gas from the Exxon station down the street.  Interns won't blow you if you're working at Wendy's after getting voted out. The fact that it will save lives is just a nice bonus
* 2 is corporate greed.  It's bad for business to be ground to a halt, and corporations know they can't rely on the government to give them juice.  Most of $BE's money thus far (we'll get to that in a moment) already comes from corporate America.  Companies like $EBAY,  $HD, $WMT, $INTC, $AAPL, $GOOGL, $ORCL, etc. already use these guys to ensure that their data centers and shipping depots are always powered on and operational because just because the apocalypse is here doesn't mean you stop making money.   Secretaries won't blow you in the executive washroom if the board fires you.
* The 3rd is as an add-on to replacements to our current grid infrastructure to harden it and provide insurance against limited disruptions.  Customers  won't blow you if their nipples are frozen.
* The 4th is a future product, but as they hone their product and reduce their cost of production, adding a small consumer grade sized server to your home could provide about 1kW of power at a cost of about 3 grand, making it a favorable alternative to a generator or a Tesla wall paired with solar panels.  Your wife won't blow you if....well, let's be honest, she just won't blow you.  Sorry.

# Under the hood:  Financials:

&#x200B;

At the time of this writing, $BE is trading at $27.14 with a market cap of 5 billion dollars.  Their 52 week high was $45, and their 52 week low was all the way down at $3.  They were recently dragged down in the broader market correction on the NASDAQ because, even though they're an energy sector play and thus shouldn't have been hit as hard, they're ""tech energy"", so they got pulled down unfairly (right along with last week's DD, $CLNE - you're welcome on that, btw).  Even th ough they have a gross margin of over 25%, they are not a profitable company because they put all of their money into R&D.  They do about a billion dollars in revenue annually and are looking at a growth rate of over 420% in the next 2 years (no, I didn't randomly pick that number off the top of my head, that's where the math leads.  It's a sign, bitches).

&#x200B;

If we look at total returns with companies $BE gets lumped in with, we see that they severely lagged in terms of return during this green energy boom:

&#x200B;

Now, there are 2 ways you can look at this:  You can be the bad kind of retarded and say it's a bad investment because  some of these other plays have performed better, or you can be the good kind of retarded and realize that these other plays that outperformed were all in the BATTERY space and that Bloom was overlooked because it plays in infrastructure, and now gets to CATCH UP to the rest of these guys that are already very crowded trades, making you a fuck ton of money.  You want to throw money in something that's already fully vested, or something that's ""got next""?

What's the smart money doing?  Let's take a look at the short interest:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Short interest](https://preview.redd.it/yb6brzpgkmm61.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a24d64a1c40698b7cc63a144f7488828f018c49)

&#x200B;

The smart money is getting the fuck out of the way because they know this thing is coiling and is gonna bust a nut all over their faces if they don't.

&#x200B;

Normalizing all of their numbers, the price target for this stonk was trending along nicely till the broader market correction the last few weeks.  And these targets were before a light got shone on how shitty our power reliability is

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Technical Teabagging:

Looking at the technicals, we see a few things.  First, on the daily it's not the smoothest price action, but we had a nice upwards channel up until the correction, and it's since gone into a descending wedge with a strong bull flag to the upside.  Now if you're looking at this and thinking to yourself ""self, this looks like a very traditional head and shoulders pattern and we've formed the right neckline"", you would be correct looking at the chart blind, but in so doing you would be ignoring the larger market correction that caused the beginning of that pattern to form, which means it'll probably be a broken H&S.  Again, these lines aren't great because I'm too lazy - I usually just eyeball it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Daily](https://preview.redd.it/21azp5m5mmm61.png?width=1207&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6e59b9f8192944a323c329bde077cc52309be70)

Expanding out to a 2 hour 20 day, things get cleaner.  Your light blue line is the 20 day moving average, the dark blue is the 50 day SMA, and the cream line is the 200 SMA.  Descending resistance, ascending support.  It's nearing the end of its coil for a breakout.  The 20 day and 50 MA will very likely be crossing in the near future at that $34 mark.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[20 day 2 hour](https://preview.redd.it/rencp872nmm61.png?width=1593&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff36a5ad641e72f0a6955d4f0c7d9ba3ec7c4857)

&#x200B;

# So, to summarize:

&#x200B;

* $BE has a lot of tailwinds at its back as the result of the recent infrastructure debacles and the calls for regulation and upgrades to infrastructure, which will only become more frequent as time progresses
* With a 3-5 year return on investment, these products present an attractive investment to corporations looking to both hedge their bets against corporate incompetence as well as reduce their exposure to carbon tax measures
* Because their products don't go into EV's and aren't working with supervillains trying to get people to buy joke currency, they were largely left behind in the recent surge in green energy valuations because people largely didn't understand their voodoo or that these guys even existed, but social awareness of them is raising.  Leaving them a lot of room to the upside to run
* Even though they should have been immune to the broader market selloff as an energy sector play (the energy stonks actually went up during that correction), they got unfairly dragged down because they're still sort of a tech play.  This creates an interesting and attractive buying opportunity, even if this stonk has run a bit since I started touting it in the dailies (as I only do one DD a week, you've missed the absolute bottom, but this is free so fuck you if you want to complain)
* They're definitely going to be getting some of that gubmit corporate stimmy money to shut AOC up.
* Microgrids to critical operations such as hospitals, nursing homes, water treatment facilities, etc. are going to become a big thing and very likely an architectural standard in the future
* **They have zero competition in the space they reside in, which is really fucking unusual**
* There's a long play here by which these things could be attractive power assurance features to new home builds or as retrofits, particularly in parts of the country where natural disasters and adverse weather frequently affect access to electricity
* They're immune to weather phenomena (and actually operate better in colder weather), making them an attractive power resiliency option

&#x200B;

# Price Targets:

&#x200B;

As I've said multiple times, this stonk was positively FLYING as it caught up to $PLUG, $FCEL, etc. in the sector as people became more aware of it as a value play.  Couple that with the tailwinds it now has as a result of a shitty winter and never ending California wildfires.  A short term price target of $32 by mid April is a bet I'd have 70% conviction on.  Barring continued market manipulation because of Boomer bonds, 45-50 by mid summer, and a long term price target (given their growth projections) of $72 are entirely within reach.

&#x200B;

# How do you play it?:

&#x200B;

You can actually FD this one, if you really want to.  This thing has a very standard behavior:  It tends to pop at the open and then fades into the day.  Further, if you time that coil right, you can experience a really nice breakout on a weekly.  Personally, I like the 5/21 32cs at anything under $4 and I was buying the shit out of them during the correction, but that's just because my brain still has like 3 wrinkles in it that I can't seem to iron out.

&#x200B;

One thing to note is this is not a high volume stonk.  Only about 35000 shares will trade hands near the open, and options interest is low enough to where if you're playing with a big bankroll, filling a large order will take time.  As such, the spreads tend to be pretty wide on this guy, so you're going to want to manually enter something that's 10 cents above the current offer price and babysit it till its filled.

&#x200B;

# Position Disclaimers:

&#x200B;

I'm balls deep in these guys, and have been since early November of last year when I purchased most of the shares my VC had from funding them a decade ago to my personal accounts as we shifted the nature of our portfolio.  Since that time, I've only added to my positions on the options chain.

* 2000 5/21 32c's at an average cost basis of 2.60
* 1000 1/22 60c's at 3 even
* 500 1/22 65c's at 2.70

I'd like to say my position is fully vested, but I've been buying every single fucking dip on this one.

Expanding out to a 2 hour 20 day, things get cleaner.  Your light blue line is the 20 day moving average, the dark blue is the 50 day SMA, and the cream line is the 200 SMA.  Descending resistance, ascending support.  It's nearing the end of its coil for a breakout.  The 20 day and 50 MA will very likely be crossing in the near future at that $34 mark.

# So, to summarize:

&#x200B;

* $BE has a lot of tailwinds at its back as the result of the recent infrastructure debacles and the calls for regulation and upgrades to infrastructure, which will only become more frequent as time progresses
* With a 3-5 year return on investment, these products present an attractive investment to corporations looking to both hedge their bets against corporate incompetence as well as reduce their exposure to carbon tax measures
* Because their products don't go into EV's and aren't working with supervillains trying to get people to buy joke currency, they were largely left behind in the recent surge in green energy valuations because people largely didn't understand their voodoo or that these guys even existed, but social awareness of them is raising.  Leaving them a lot of room to the upside to run
* Even though they should have been immune to the broader market selloff as an energy sector play (the energy stonks actually went up during that correction), they got unfairly dragged down because they're still sort of a tech play.  This creates an interesting and attractive buying opportunity, even if this stonk has run a bit since I started touting it in the dailies (as I only do one DD a week, you've missed the absolute bottom, but this is free so fuck you if you want to complain)
* They're definitely going to be getting some of that gubmit corporate stimmy money to shut AOC up.
* Microgrids to critical operations such as hospitals, nursing homes, water treatment facilities, etc. are going to become a big thing and very likely an architectural standard in the future
* **They have zero competition in the space they reside in, which is really fucking unusual**
* There's a long play here by which these things could be attractive power assurance features to new home builds or as retrofits, particularly in parts of the country where natural disasters and adverse weather frequently affect access to electricity
* They're immune to weather phenomena (and actually operate better in colder weather), making them an attractive power resiliency option

&#x200B;

# Price Targets:

&#x200B;

As I've said multiple times, this stonk was positively FLYING as it caught up to $PLUG, $FCEL, etc. in the sector as people became more aware of it as a value play.  Couple that with the tailwinds it now has as a result of a shitty winter and never ending California wildfires.  A short term price target of $32 by mid April is a bet I'd have 70% conviction on.  Barring continued market manipulation because of Boomer bonds, 45-50 by mid summer, and a long term price target (given their growth projections) of $72 are entirely within reach.

&#x200B;

# How do you play it?:

&#x200B;

You can actually FD this one, if you really want to.  This thing has a very standard behavior:  It tends to pop at the open and then fades into the day.  Further, if you time that coil right, you can experience a really nice breakout on a weekly.  Personally, I like the 5/21 32cs at anything under $4 and I was buying the shit out of them during the correction, but that's just because my brain still has like 3 wrinkles in it that I can't seem to iron out.

&#x200B;

One thing to note is this is not a high volume stonk.  Only about 35000 shares will trade hands near the open, and options interest is low enough to where if you're playing with a big bankroll, filling a large order will take time.  As such, the spreads tend to be pretty wide on this guy, so you're going to want to manually enter something that's 10 cents above the current offer price and babysit it till its filled.

&#x200B;

# Position Disclaimers:

&#x200B;

I'm balls deep in these guys, and have been since early November of last year when I purchased most of the shares my VC had from funding them a decade ago to my personal accounts as we shifted the nature of our portfolio.  Since that time, I've only added to my positions on the options chain.

&#x200B;

* 263,800 shares @ $14
* 2000 5/21 32c's at an average cost basis of 2.60
* 1000 1/22 60c's at 3 even
* 500 1/22 65c's at 2.70

I'd like to say my position is fully vested, but I've been buying every single fucking dip on this one.

&#x200B;

All my love,

# The New Normal (disruption)

Whether you're a believer in climate change or a denier of it, one thing we can all agree on is that extreme weather patterns  (by view of our short lifespans) are becoming more and more frequent, whether you think it's because that's just how things go or if cow farts are going to doom us all. Weather related damage to life, liberty, and the pursuit of tendies is now averaging 22 billion dollars a year in the United States absent of cost to infrastructure disruptions, with power disruption phenomena contributing to over 50,000 deaths per year.  As we continue to evolve and become more reliant upon technology, distributed data platforms, IoT, EVs, robot surgeons, etc., disruptions in access to power render us completely impotent to function as a society.

&#x200B;

# Our crumbling infrastructure:

&#x200B;

Thanks to the Boomers who have been wasting our immense wealth on blow, being able to see the pimples on Jenna Jameson's ass in 20 year old videos while they flaccidly beat off in their office, and in general fucking everything in this world up, the American Society of Civil Engineers has given our power grid infrastructure a D-minus grade.  Not only are there many single points of failure, the grid we presently have was only rated for 50 years of service, and a huge percentage of it is well beyond that expected lifespan.  Meanwhile, our consumption demands have increased exponentially and will continue to do so both as our population expands due to a combination of your wife's boyfriend continually getting her pregnant (or open border policies, whichever you believe in) as well as our fucked up attempts to become the Jetsons.  These are streams that should not be crossed, but we're doing it anyways because we're in the early stages of the Idiocracy documentary.

&#x200B;

# Enter $BE.  So what do these guys do?  The 3 R's:  Resiliency, Redundancy, and Retardedness

First, let's get one thing out of the way:  These guys are NOT primarily a play on replacing municipal infrastructure with green energy like solar or wind farms for large capacity energy production.  That's a crowded space, and they'd be a bad competitor there.  What they are a play on is providing MICROGRIDS for critical infrastructure to ensure continuous power delivery to essential services.  Their product provides RESILIENCY and REDUNDANCY to individual campuses and facilities to ensure that, even in the absolute worst case scenario, the wheels keep turning at vulnerable locales.  Think hospitals, water treatment facilities, nursing homes, airports, etc. at the lower level of Maslow's hierarchy and data centers, shipping hubs and the CEO's 7th vacation villa at the corporate level.  The things that will grind something to a screeching halt in the event of power failure.  The 3rd R is just a reminder that, if you're reading this, you're retarded.  Just thought you might need a reminder.

&#x200B;

# OK, HOW do they do it?  What makes them special/different?  Elon says solar and batteries are the futurez, man

&#x200B;

$BE is different than most green energy plays in that they make solid oxide fuel cells they call servers that will convert fuel (usually hydrogen, but they can run on RNG or ethanol, as well) to electricity WITHOUT combustion (that's the big differentiator here).  I won't get too sciency here because you smooth brains wouldn't get it, but it's got electrolytes, and that's what plants crave, bitches.  They require no precious metals (so no shortage concerns).  Each ""server"", which runs about 3/4 of a million dollars a unit, produces 250 kw of juice and can power 1 30,000 square foot commercial space or up to 100 homes.  These servers produce energy at 55% efficiency (for point of comparison, solar is 12%).  They do produce CO2 as waste, but only half as much as natural gas power stations.  When using RNG as the fuel source, they are a net-zero carbon emission product, which is good both for government spending programs to appease the Sierra Club as well as carbon tax dodging companies.  They're also presently burning all their positive cash flow into figuring out how to harness the CO2 these produce to turn it into some other form of energy, which would make them a CARBON NEGATIVE product if they pull it off.  That's Star Trek shit right there. These servers pay for themselves in an average of 3-5 years, making them an attractive long-term investment, especially against the 17 years it takes for solar to pay for itself.

&#x200B;

Most importantly, they operate completely independently of a power grid and are not subject to adverse weather impacting their functionality (like a solar panel getting covered with snow or temperatures falling so low that nat gas plants and windmills freeze), guaranteeing reliable access to power.  Elon's mega batteries are still constrained by the limitation that power needs to be injected into the batteries and those batteries can be drained.  These fuel cells will always operate and never run out of juice barring a component failure.

&#x200B;

**All of this is important because it highlights the fact that $BE has no real competitors on the market for the niche they've filled, and aren't going to be hampered by price increases/hunting for lithium, rare earth metals, chip shortages, etc.  The only comparable company out there is Ballard Power Systems, who is focused more on buses, industrial machinery, trains, etc., not infrastructure.   Ballard is trying to fight in the battery space, which is very crowded.**

&#x200B;

# Fuck you, Mr. Wizard - TENDIES, fucker!

&#x200B;

Alright, alright, alright.  Chill the fuck out.  I'm sorry your wife didn't peg you last night and now you're surly.  These dudes are gonna make money 4 ways:

&#x200B;

* 1 is the human life aspect.  Loss of life is tragic, but let's be honest:  Mostly, it's just bad optics if you're a politician, and what happened in Texas and California threatens political job security.    If they can spend YOUR money to ensure that they can keep TAKING money from you, they're gonna be all ears.  Expect a lot of regulation in the coming years mandating that essential facilities have access to reliable off-grid power in the case of natural disaster, Hungarian hackers or Chinese invaders.  And we can't just have Becky from HR run out to the Generac every 20 minutes to fill it with gas from the Exxon station down the street.  Interns won't blow you if you're working at Wendy's after getting voted out. The fact that it will save lives is just a nice bonus
* 2 is corporate greed.  It's bad for business to be ground to a halt, and corporations know they can't rely on the government to give them juice.  Most of $BE's money thus far (we'll get to that in a moment) already comes from corporate America.  Companies like $EBAY,  $HD, $WMT, $INTC, $AAPL, $GOOGL, $ORCL, etc. already use these guys to ensure that their data centers and shipping depots are always powered on and operational because just because the apocalypse is here doesn't mean you stop making money.   Secretaries won't blow you in the executive washroom if the board fires you.
* The 3rd is as an add-on to replacements to our current grid infrastructure to harden it and provide insurance against limited disruptions.  Customers  won't blow you if their nipples are frozen.
* The 4th is a future product, but as they hone their product and reduce their cost of production, adding a small consumer grade sized server to your home could provide about 1kW of power at a cost of about 3 grand, making it a favorable alternative to a generator or a Tesla wall paired with solar panels.  Your wife won't blow you if....well, let's be honest, she just won't blow you.  Sorry.

# Under the hood:  Financials:

&#x200B;

At the time of this writing, $BE is trading at $27.14 with a market cap of 5 billion dollars.  Their 52 week high was $45, and their 52 week low was all the way down at $3.  They were recently dragged down in the broader market correction on the NASDAQ because, even though they're an energy sector play and thus shouldn't have been hit as hard, they're ""tech energy"", so they got pulled down unfairly (right along with last week's DD, $CLNE - you're welcome on that, btw).  Even th ough they have a gross margin of over 25%, they are not a profitable company because they put all of their money into R&D.  They do about a billion dollars in revenue annually and are looking at a growth rate of over 420% in the next 2 years (no, I didn't randomly pick that number off the top of my head, that's where the math leads.  It's a sign, bitches).

&#x200B;

If we look at total returns with companies $BE gets lumped in with, we see that they severely lagged in terms of return during this green energy boom:

&#x200B;

Now, there are 2 ways you can look at this:  You can be the bad kind of retarded and say it's a bad investment because  some of these other plays have performed better, or you can be the good kind of retarded and realize that these other plays that outperformed were all in the BATTERY space and that Bloom was overlooked because it plays in infrastructure, and now gets to CATCH UP to the rest of these guys that are already very crowded trades, making you a fuck ton of money.  You want to throw money in something that's already fully vested, or something that's ""got next""?

What's the smart money doing?  Let's take a look at the short interest:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Short interest](https://preview.redd.it/yb6brzpgkmm61.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a24d64a1c40698b7cc63a144f7488828f018c49)

&#x200B;

The smart money is getting the fuck out of the way because they know this thing is coiling and is gonna bust a nut all over their faces if they don't.

&#x200B;

Normalizing all of their numbers, the price target for this stonk was trending along nicely till the broader market correction the last few weeks.  And these targets were before a light got shone on how shitty our power reliability is

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Technical Teabagging:

Looking at the technicals, we see a few things.  First, on the daily it's not the smoothest price action, but we had a nice upwards channel up until the correction, and it's since gone into a descending wedge with a strong bull flag to the upside.  Now if you're looking at this and thinking to yourself ""self, this looks like a very traditional head and shoulders pattern and we've formed the right neckline"", you would be correct looking at the chart blind, but in so doing you would be ignoring the larger market correction that caused the beginning of that pattern to form, which means it'll probably be a broken H&S.  Again, these lines aren't great because I'm too lazy - I usually just eyeball it.

* The 4th is a future product, but as they hone their product and reduce their cost of production, adding a small consumer grade sized server to your home could provide about 1kW of power at a cost of about 3 grand, making it a favorable alternative to a generator or a Tesla wall paired with solar panels.  Your wife won't blow you if....well, let's be honest, she just won't blow you.  Sorry.

# Under the hood:  Financials:

&#x200B;

At the time of this writing, $BE is trading at $27.14 with a market cap of 5 billion dollars.  Their 52 week high was $45, and their 52 week low was all the way down at $3.  They were recently dragged down in the broader market correction on the NASDAQ because, even though they're an energy sector play and thus shouldn't have been hit as hard, they're ""tech energy"", so they got pulled down unfairly (right along with last week's DD, $CLNE - you're welcome on that, btw).  Even th ough they have a gross margin of over 25%, they are not a profitable company because they put all of their money into R&D.  They do about a billion dollars in revenue annually and are looking at a growth rate of over 420% in the next 2 years (no, I didn't randomly pick that number off the top of my head, that's where the math leads.  It's a sign, bitches).

&#x200B;

If we look at total returns with companies $BE gets lumped in with, we see that they severely lagged in terms of return during this green energy boom:

&#x200B;

Now, there are 2 ways you can look at this:  You can be the bad kind of retarded and say it's a bad investment because  some of these other plays have performed better, or you can be the good kind of retarded and realize that these other plays that outperformed were all in the BATTERY space and that Bloom was overlooked because it plays in infrastructure, and now gets to CATCH UP to the rest of these guys that are already very crowded trades, making you a fuck ton of money.  You want to throw money in something that's already fully vested, or something that's ""got next""?

What's the smart money doing?  Let's take a look at the short interest:

&#x200B;

The smart money is getting the fuck out of the way because they know this thing is coiling and is gonna bust a nut all over their faces if they don't.

&#x200B;

Normalizing all of their numbers, the price target for this stonk was trending along nicely till the broader market correction the last few weeks.  And these targets were before a light got shone on how shitty our power reliability is

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Technical Teabagging:

Looking at the technicals, we see a few things.  First, on the daily it's not the smoothest price action, but we had a nice upwards channel up until the correction, and it's since gone into a descending wedge with a strong bull flag to the upside.  Now if you're looking at this and thinking to yourself ""self, this looks like a very traditional head and shoulders pattern and we've formed the right neckline"", you would be correct looking at the chart blind, but in so doing you would be ignoring the larger market correction that caused the beginning of that pattern to form, which means it'll probably be a broken H&S.  Again, these lines aren't great because I'm too lazy - I usually just eyeball it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Daily](https://preview.redd.it/21azp5m5mmm61.png?width=1207&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6e59b9f8192944a323c329bde077cc52309be70)

Expanding out to a 2 hour 20 day, things get cleaner.  Your light blue line is the 20 day moving average, the dark blue is the 50 day SMA, and the cream line is the 200 SMA.  Descending resistance, ascending support.  It's nearing the end of its coil for a breakout.  The 20 day and 50 MA will very likely be crossing in the near future at that $34 mark.

&#x200B;

# So, to summarize:

&#x200B;

* $BE has a lot of tailwinds at its back as the result of the recent infrastructure debacles and the calls for regulation and upgrades to infrastructure, which will only become more frequent as time progresses
* With a 3-5 year return on investment, these products present an attractive investment to corporations looking to both hedge their bets against corporate incompetence as well as reduce their exposure to carbon tax measures
* Because their products don't go into EV's and aren't working with supervillains trying to get people to buy joke currency, they were largely left behind in the recent surge in green energy valuations because people largely didn't understand their voodoo or that these guys even existed, but social awareness of them is raising.  Leaving them a lot of room to the upside to run
* Even though they should have been immune to the broader market selloff as an energy sector play (the energy stonks actually went up during that correction), they got unfairly dragged down because they're still sort of a tech play.  This creates an interesting and attractive buying opportunity, even if this stonk has run a bit since I started touting it in the dailies (as I only do one DD a week, you've missed the absolute bottom, but this is free so fuck you if you want to complain)
* They're definitely going to be getting some of that gubmit corporate stimmy money to shut AOC up.
* Microgrids to critical operations such as hospitals, nursing homes, water treatment facilities, etc. are going to become a big thing and very likely an architectural standard in the future
* **They have zero competition in the space they reside in, which is really fucking unusual**
* There's a long play here by which these things could be attractive power assurance features to new home builds or as retrofits, particularly in parts of the country where natural disasters and adverse weather frequently affect access to electricity
* They're immune to weather phenomena (and actually operate better in colder weather), making them an attractive power resiliency option

&#x200B;

# Price Targets:

&#x200B;

As I've said multiple times, this stonk was positively FLYING as it caught up to $PLUG, $FCEL, etc. in the sector as people became more aware of it as a value play.  Couple that with the tailwinds it now has as a result of a shitty winter and never ending California wildfires.  A short term price target of $32 by mid April is a bet I'd have 70% conviction on.  Barring continued market manipulation because of Boomer bonds, 45-50 by mid summer, and a long term price target (given their growth projections) of $72 are entirely within reach.

&#x200B;

# How do you play it?:

&#x200B;

You can actually FD this one, if you really want to.  This thing has a very standard behavior:  It tends to pop at the open and then fades into the day.  Further, if you time that coil right, you can experience a really nice breakout on a weekly.  Personally, I like the 5/21 32cs at anything under $4 and I was buying the shit out of them during the correction, but that's just because my brain still has like 3 wrinkles in it that I can't seem to iron out.

&#x200B;

One thing to note is this is not a high volume stonk.  Only about 35000 shares will trade hands near the open, and options interest is low enough to where if you're playing with a big bankroll, filling a large order will take time.  As such, the spreads tend to be pretty wide on this guy, so you're going to want to manually enter something that's 10 cents above the current offer price and babysit it till its filled.

&#x200B;

# Position Disclaimers:

&#x200B;

I'm balls deep in these guys, and have been since early November of last year when I purchased most of the shares my VC had from funding them a decade ago to my personal accounts as we shifted the nature of our portfolio.  Since that time, I've only added to my positions on the options chain.

&#x200B;

* 263,800 shares @ $14
* 2000 5/21 32c's at an average cost basis of 2.60
* 1000 1/22 60c's at 3 even
* 500 1/22 65c's at 2.70

I'd like to say my position is fully vested, but I've been buying every single fucking dip on this one.

I present to you:  Bloom Energy ($BE)

&#x200B;

# The New Normal (disruption)

Whether you're a believer in climate change or a denier of it, one thing we can all agree on is that extreme weather patterns  (by view of our short lifespans) are becoming more and more frequent, whether you think it's because that's just how things go or if cow farts are going to doom us all. Weather related damage to life, liberty, and the pursuit of tendies is now averaging 22 billion dollars a year in the United States absent of cost to infrastructure disruptions, with power disruption phenomena contributing to over 50,000 deaths per year.  As we continue to evolve and become more reliant upon technology, distributed data platforms, IoT, EVs, robot surgeons, etc., disruptions in access to power render us completely impotent to function as a society.

&#x200B;

# Our crumbling infrastructure:

&#x200B;

Thanks to the Boomers who have been wasting our immense wealth on blow, being able to see the pimples on Jenna Jameson's ass in 20 year old videos while they flaccidly beat off in their office, and in general fucking everything in this world up, the American Society of Civil Engineers has given our power grid infrastructure a D-minus grade.  Not only are there many single points of failure, the grid we presently have was only rated for 50 years of service, and a huge percentage of it is well beyond that expected lifespan.  Meanwhile, our consumption demands have increased exponentially and will continue to do so both as our population expands due to a combination of your wife's boyfriend continually getting her pregnant (or open border policies, whichever you believe in) as well as our fucked up attempts to become the Jetsons.  These are streams that should not be crossed, but we're doing it anyways because we're in the early stages of the Idiocracy documentary.

&#x200B;

# Enter $BE.  So what do these guys do?  The 3 R's:  Resiliency, Redundancy, and Retardedness

First, let's get one thing out of the way:  These guys are NOT primarily a play on replacing municipal infrastructure with green energy like solar or wind farms for large capacity energy production.  That's a crowded space, and they'd be a bad competitor there.  What they are a play on is providing MICROGRIDS for critical infrastructure to ensure continuous power delivery to essential services.  Their product provides RESILIENCY and REDUNDANCY to individual campuses and facilities to ensure that, even in the absolute worst case scenario, the wheels keep turning at vulnerable locales.  Think hospitals, water treatment facilities, nursing homes, airports, etc. at the lower level of Maslow's hierarchy and data centers, shipping hubs and the CEO's 7th vacation villa at the corporate level.  The things that will grind something to a screeching halt in the event of power failure.  The 3rd R is just a reminder that, if you're reading this, you're retarded.  Just thought you might need a reminder.

&#x200B;

# OK, HOW do they do it?  What makes them special/different?  Elon says solar and batteries are the futurez, man

&#x200B;

$BE is different than most green energy plays in that they make solid oxide fuel cells they call servers that will convert fuel (usually hydrogen, but they can run on RNG or ethanol, as well) to electricity WITHOUT combustion (that's the big differentiator here).  I won't get too sciency here because you smooth brains wouldn't get it, but it's got electrolytes, and that's what plants crave, bitches.  They require no precious metals (so no shortage concerns).  Each ""server"", which runs about 3/4 of a million dollars a unit, produces 250 kw of juice and can power 1 30,000 square foot commercial space or up to 100 homes.  These servers produce energy at 55% efficiency (for point of comparison, solar is 12%).  They do produce CO2 as waste, but only half as much as natural gas power stations.  When using RNG as the fuel source, they are a net-zero carbon emission product, which is good both for government spending programs to appease the Sierra Club as well as carbon tax dodging companies.  They're also presently burning all their positive cash flow into figuring out how to harness the CO2 these produce to turn it into some other form of energy, which would make them a CARBON NEGATIVE product if they pull it off.  That's Star Trek shit right there. These servers pay for themselves in an average of 3-5 years, making them an attractive long-term investment, especially against the 17 years it takes for solar to pay for itself.

&#x200B;

Most importantly, they operate completely independently of a power grid and are not subject to adverse weather impacting their functionality (like a solar panel getting covered with snow or temperatures falling so low that nat gas plants and windmills freeze), guaranteeing reliable access to power.  Elon's mega batteries are still constrained by the limitation that power needs to be injected into the batteries and those batteries can be drained.  These fuel cells will always operate and never run out of juice barring a component failure.

&#x200B;

**All of this is important because it highlights the fact that $BE has no real competitors on the market for the niche they've filled, and aren't going to be hampered by price increases/hunting for lithium, rare earth metals, chip shortages, etc.  The only comparable company out there is Ballard Power Systems, who is focused more on buses, industrial machinery, trains, etc., not infrastructure.   Ballard is trying to fight in the battery space, which is very crowded.**

&#x200B;

# Fuck you, Mr. Wizard - TENDIES, fucker!

&#x200B;

Alright, alright, alright.  Chill the fuck out.  I'm sorry your wife didn't peg you last night and now you're surly.  These dudes are gonna make money 4 ways:

&#x200B;

* 1 is the human life aspect.  Loss of life is tragic, but let's be honest:  Mostly, it's just bad optics if you're a politician, and what happened in Texas and California threatens political job security.    If they can spend YOUR money to ensure that they can keep TAKING money from you, they're gonna be all ears.  Expect a lot of regulation in the coming years mandating that essential facilities have access to reliable off-grid power in the case of natural disaster, Hungarian hackers or Chinese invaders.  And we can't just have Becky from HR run out to the Generac every 20 minutes to fill it with gas from the Exxon station down the street.  Interns won't blow you if you're working at Wendy's after getting voted out. The fact that it will save lives is just a nice bonus
* 2 is corporate greed.  It's bad for business to be ground to a halt, and corporations know they can't rely on the government to give them juice.  Most of $BE's money thus far (we'll get to that in a moment) already comes from corporate America.  Companies like $EBAY,  $HD, $WMT, $INTC, $AAPL, $GOOGL, $ORCL, etc. already use these guys to ensure that their data centers and shipping depots are always powered on and operational because just because the apocalypse is here doesn't mean you stop making money.   Secretaries won't blow you in the executive washroom if the board fires you.
* The 3rd is as an add-on to replacements to our current grid infrastructure to harden it and provide insurance against limited disruptions.  Customers  won't blow you if their nipples are frozen.
* The 4th is a future product, but as they hone their product and reduce their cost of production, adding a small consumer grade sized server to your home could provide about 1kW of power at a cost of about 3 grand, making it a favorable alternative to a generator or a Tesla wall paired with solar panels.  Your wife won't blow you if....well, let's be honest, she just won't blow you.  Sorry.

* Cashflow generative
* The rotation into cyclical and the valuation due to growth not being a scarcity anymore
* Valuation: it has been lagging even S&P in return despite a 17% yoy increase in GMV in 2020

But most importantly, I think its business model makes a lot of sense. It cherry-picked the most value add to the sellers on the platform. It doesn't get involved in shipping unless it is global, then it uses its own freight forwarding to backout fx, shipping, and custom. This is a big differentiator in the platform and solves the main pain point. But it does not get into the 2-day free shipping etc, as it is logistically convoluted and costly. It also does not alienate sellers or try to compete for their business.

What it lacks is an experience for buyers that is as convincing as the seller's side.

And I believe that is coming. In the past year, it has improved the buyer's experience with authentication rollout and more curation. It touts more millennials and gen z on the platform, especially in the circular 2nd hand goods.

Here are the specifics;

1, competitive advantage: global

The big increase during the pandemic because of the access to global supply chains. These customers once on-boarded are actually sticky with similar attributes to the previous cohorts.

The global reach is enabled by the global dropshipping and freight forwarding program of eBay, which is a pain point of amazon, tmall, etc.

Given eBay is also ⅓ split among, us, Europe, and the rest of the world, this will be a meaningful point.

2, capturing the zeitgeist is an opportunity

eBay is now methodically rolling out new verticals that capture the zeitgeist. Their current pushes are sneakers and luxury watches. These are high-growth categories. The specifics might fade, but they are constantly searching for new verticals to add.

There will be new tulips and eBay has been quite able to capture them. This represents a small percentage of GMV but it brings new buyers and sellers onto the platform maintaining market share as well as mind share

This effort is credible as if there is something you don’t think you can find anywhere, you will try eBay. (eg, oil tanker)

Short interest: 3.2 days to cover

Valuation on DCF: $89, upside \~62%

1615557996.0,TELL,"So, you did it. You did your due diligence, you did the math, you summoned your courage to press that 'Buy' button, and now those stocks and options have granted you a title you only dreamed of having.

""Millionaire"".

Congratulations! You beat the odds that so many before you have failed to overcome. You played the game, and came out on top. Now it's time to buy that house you always dreamed of, or that car you always wanted to drive, right? Sure, *if you want to lose your title of millionaire*. However, if you 'd like to stay a millionaire, there are some things you may like to consider. *This is not financial advice,* but rather, 3 pieces of life suggestions. A survival guide so to speak, of the next 6 months and how to protect your new title.

&#x200B;

* First, protect it from everyone else.

**DON'T TELL ANYBODY.** If there is one thing you take away from this, let it be this. So let me repeat that...

**DON'T.**

**TELL.**

**ANYONE.**

This is going to be your most well kept secret in your life. You will probably feel the urge to tell your friends, and your family, but doing this *WILL* ruin your life. Why? Well everyone is gonna want a cut. They're gonna say they need that new device, or they need that new car, or they need this or that. They'll bring up how far you go back. Suddenly, you'll see the very people who have been your friends, turn on you like vultures. They may think they have your best interests in mind, and they may not the harm they're causing, but they'll smell money, and they're gonna come asking.

In that case, you've gotta be the bad guy. You've gotta be the one to say, ""no."" And friendships are going to quickly fall apart as you deny them. Or you're gonna bleed your money 'helping' everyone while they take advantage of you and indulge their overspending habits.

To put it differently, this isn't a question of who do you tell, because word spreads. Rather, this is a question of social survival. Do you want to maintain your relationship with your friends and family? Yes? Then keep it to yourself. *Money talks, but wealth whispers.*

&#x200B;

* Second, protect it from expenses.

If you want this money to last more than 5 years, you're gonna want to treat it as if it wasn't there.

*""Wait, what? Then why do I have this money if I'm not gonna use it?!""* You will use it. Just not as a sum of cash. If you have $1.8 million, you are not going to go out and buy a $1 million dollar house and a $200,000 Lamborghini. You'll only have $600,000 left! Instead, you might want to turn to **FIRE**, or **Financial Independence, Retire Early.** There, you are going to use your newfound money as a source of *income.* An easy equation for this is 4%. That's it. That's the equation. 4% of your net worth can be used yearly, while your money still sits in investments and accrues roughly 7% interest annually. This way you beat inflation, and you cover your expenses.

So, to use our $1.8 million under the 4% rule, that's *$72,000* you can spend annually, and in theory you will never run out of funds, while never working another day in your life. Or, if you enjoy what you're doing, you can add that to the equation as well. How you break it up is up to you, but you can very easily spend north of $100,000 a year, and still be in the green if you hold down a job.

Meanwhile, let's check in on our $600,000. That's *$24,000* a year you can spend for the rest of your life if you wanted to retire today. That's uncomfortably close to poverty. You don't deserve that.

&#x200B;

* Third, protect it from yourself.

Yes. Yourself. As quickly as you made your money, you can easily lose it in the best 2 weeks of your life. So right now, emotions are probably high. You're beyond excited, you are itching to do something crazy with your money, and probably want to buy something, since you can't tell anyone per part 1.**Don't buy anything right now.**

Yes, you read that right. Don't buy anything. If you need any proof on that, look up what happens to lottery winners, roughly 35% of which go *bankrupt*. Rather, set the money aside for a while. You can determine this amount of time, but a good rule of thumb is 6 months. In those 6 months, it gives you plenty of time to calm yourself, collect your thoughts, and figure out an actual plan on how to wisely use that money. How you want to invest it, how much you want to use per year, and how much you owe in *taxes*. Yes. The dreaded, 't-word'. *Taxes*. You've gotta pay up. And during that planning process, you'll have to come to terms with what this money is going to do for your life.

&#x200B;

So there you have it. A starter guide on how to survive your first days as a new millionaire, written by someone who has never been a millionaire! But I have seen some people make some awful mistakes about money, and did my due diligence on what happens after someone gains a massive windfall. And I have a feeling that more than a handful of you might be seeing a windfall come your way in the near future...

&#x200B;

To close, they say money can't buy you happiness, but I'm often reminded of the scene from Captain America.

https://i.redd.it/6zrwsfsstlm61.gif

Money is only going to amplify how you want to live your life. If you want to live generously, leaving anonymous gifts and donations, giving all you have away, you can do that. If you want to live egregiously expensive and live it up, over spending at every turn, you can also do that. But you will need to face the consequences of either decision.

And if you, in your nature, default to one of these paths, but don't want to, it will take all the more effort to avoid it than if you didn't have this money at all.

&#x200B;

Oh who am I kidding. This is WallStreetBets. You will all be fine. Just be careful, my friends. As this is a fight that may last the rest of your life.

&#x200B;

Edit: While I mentioned it in point 3, it should absolutely be a point of it's own. So, by popular demand...

&#x200B;

* Fourth, protect it from the government.

Roughly 40% of earnings is going to go to the federal government if you're earning over 1,000,000. That's not even accounting for any state income taxes (which vary wildly from state to state). And before we continue, I will allow a moment for a collective ""ouch"" from everyone reading.

That's a lot. I won't deny that. But as much as it sucks, you've gotta pay up. Because if you don't, the IRS can very, very easily take ALL of it. 100%. And they will, leaving you behind with nothing but lawyer and court fees, and no money to pay them. So please, please, please, make sure you pay the taxes my friends!",How to Keep Your Newly Minted Title of Millionaire,m3i8kc,1000,5952,0.97,5952,0,,Discussion,False,True,-1

Disclosure: I have not received my stimulus (duh) and I was waiting to receive it in the bank before I invested it but I was thinking that is what most retail investors will be same thing thus pushing prices higher than they would be if I could have invested today (typing this I realize that because this is my presumption that the market could and will likely do the exact opposite). 

Tech stocks are not back to their all time highs so part of me wonders if that still counts as ‘a dip’? Apple still seems like a good value but I was mostly going to invest in VTI, QQQ and maybe some more SQ with the money. 

Am I making a classic mistake in trying to time the market or am I being proactive about my investments? Also would like to hear everyone else’s plans for investing their $,$$$",Should I spend my stimulus money now (buy the dip?) before everyone else floods the market with their $1400 checks?,m3a9hw,159,397,0.95,397,0,,Discussion,False,True,-1

&#x200B;

Sit down, shut the fuck up, and close that r/gangbang tab of your wife and her boyfriends, because you're about to get slapped with some **real** deep dick value.

&#x200B;

A few months ago, I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jy3up1/dr_michael_burry_is_gonna_ilumnate_your_portfolio/) DD to WSB outlining how I thought LUMN was the bee's knees. I still think that. There has been some development in the stock since I posted that DD, and I think that y'all deserve an update. Because frankly, the pitiful DD I've seen on LUMN since, one of which references why ""Cables are like the future, man"", and another that had more emojis in it than a tweenage girl's apple chat, is well, unsettling. So you're fucking welcome.

**Act 1: Dr. Christian Bale, PHD, MD.**

For those of you who are too retarded to read my first DD, what initially got me interested in LUMN was a [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761920019679/0001567619-20-019679-index.htm) filed by the one and only Michael Burry, who will henceforth be referred to Dr. Christan Bale, PHD, MD. As seen in the excellent movie The Big Short, Christian Bale is basically an autist who reads approximately 10 million pages of housing loans, and figures out that the trading of [Collateral Debt Obligations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp) on subprime mortgages was going to crash the housing market.  Dr. Bale then buys approximately $1.3 Billion of [Credit Default Swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp), which is a kind of like a bet on a loan defaulting and proceeds to ride the housing market crash to tendie town. Is he the gayest of bears? No he's fucking not. They weren't puts, were they?

Confused about my lazy explanation of both an Academy Award-winning film and complex financial products? I don't fucking care. Google it, or watch the movie. Margot Robbie will explain it all to you, plus she'll get your dick hard. (Or your pussy wet. Idk I've seen some thots around here lately too).

Christian Bale has now increased his position in LUMN, per his last [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761921003819/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml), and it is now his fourth largest holding. Remember that other stock that Bale invested in that helped put u/deepfuckingvalue on the map? What was it called again....? Idr. Oh well. Moving on.

**Act 2: A New Breed**

Ok, with that out of the way, onto the stock TL;DR at the bottom.

LUMN is formerly CenturyLink. Most of you are young enough now to not know that this company used to be shit, and was a part of a dying telecom industry that provided mostly phone lines, and no one except grandma has got phone lines in their house anymore. And grandmas die every day. So, much like the cigarette industry, CenturyLink's customer base was rapidly dwindling. Unlike the cigarette industry, CenturyLink could not replace them faster than they died.

&#x200B;

Until recently.

LUMN has rapidly transitoned to a cutting edge fouth industrial revolution company that is investing heavily in all the cool jazz that the kids love today, like hybrid cloud systems, adaptive network systems, AI driven adaptive threat recognition programs and advanced collaboration systems, which they have recently expanded with a partnership with [ZM](https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/lumen-expands-partnership-zoom).

&#x200B;

Recently, they presented at the Morgan Stanley Technology Summit. I didn't watch that shit, but I guess it went well because the stock rallied almost 8% the day after, despite the market collapsing around it. I meant to post this shit before that summit, but was too busy getting my ass raped by PLTR weeklies to care.

LUMN is now trading at a cool $13.60, up from $9.76 when I first tried to bring you degenerates on board. Not bad for a boomer stock.

On top of this, insiders have been absolutely loading shares, you'd think this stock was [GME](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=lumn&o=&pl=&ph=&ll=&lh=&fd=730&fdr=&td=0&tdr=&fdlyl=&fdlyh=&daysago=&xp=1&vl=25&vh=&ocl=&och=&sic1=-1&sicl=100&sich=9999&grp=0&nfl=&nfh=&nil=&nih=&nol=&noh=&v2l=&v2h=&oc2l=&oc2h=&sortcol=0&cnt=100&page=1), or something.

&#x200B;

**Act 3: Money and All That Shit**

LUMN recently had their Earnings Report. After which, they got fucking obliterated. Personally, I think the finanicals are greatly improving. Let's discuss why, ok?

* Their non GAAP EPS was $0.48 per share, against the estimate of $0.30 per share, beating the average consensus estimate by 37%.
* EBITDA was $8.6B vs $8.9B in 2019.
* Their net income improved from -$5.2B to -$1.2B.
* Operating Expenses were reduced by by almost $570 Million.
* Their net profit margin was improved from a solid -24.33% in 2019 to -5.6% in 2020.

Ratios:

* Price to Sales .51 in 2020 from .66 in 2019.
* Price to Book .96 in 2020 up from 1.07 in 2019.
* Price to Cash Flow 1.61 in 2020 from 2.12 in 2019.

&#x200B;

Don't understand what any of this means? Me either, basically. But know this: LUMN's evaluation ratios are knock any one of their competitors in the 5G industry far, far out of the park. They are a company with a $10B market cap that does sales north of $20B. For comparison, TSLA's Price to Sales ratio is 24.23. If you don't understand why a lower number is better here, fucking google it. Because I lied. I do understand the financials but I'm too lazy to explain it all.

**Act 4: Forward Looking Statements**

Here are some additional reasons why I think this company will make your portfolio super duper green:

* LUMN owns one of the largest fiber networks in the world, with over 450,000 miles of fiber owned in North America alone. They also own the largest fiber network in Asia, where the expected CAGR of 5G Utilization is [46.4%](https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/asia-pacific-5g-enterprise-market-to-witness-massive-growth-by-2024-as-mega-trends-fuel-industry-transformation-870296850.html).
* Asians aren't the only folks LUMN loves they recently hired [Quincy L. Allen](http://blackmillionaires.blogspot.com/2011/08/quincy-l-allen.html) to their board of directors, not only because he's a successful dude, but because, you know, #BLM, as the kids say.
* Companies like AT&T and Verizon will rely heavily on fiber providers to expand the next wave of 5G, which, as you cool kids know, is the next bee's knees. There have been some unsubstanitated chatter of a potential buyout by AT&T. But take that shit with a grain of rice. Still, with how cheap options still are on LUMN, it's worth the gamble IMO.
* There has been a steady increase in [Darkpool Prints](https://twitter.com/darkpoolcharts/status/1364034343480545280) on LUMN since February of this year. For those of you who don't know what darkpool trades are, basically, folks with huge amounts of money will trade stocks on a private exchange because the size would otherwise throw the equity price out of whack on the public markets. Like, a lot of money. Like, more than you fucks who bought into GME at $400 have made so far.
* LUMN is prime to drop a bomb in the the near future. There was a lot, a lot of attention at the MS Tech Summit and LUMN got some attention, as previously mentioned above. Options volume has spiked, and the Put to Call ratio is a respectable .14. Bottom line, not alot of gaybears in the LUMN camp.
* There's a chance of a big upcoming catalyst at any turn with LUMN. However, I think the safe move here, and the best way to generate TENDIES, is leaps. For those of you who don't know what leaps are, they're pretty much the opposite of FD's. **It is possible to buy an option that expires farther than this friday, not sure if you fucks knew that.**

And yes, Sir, I know this is a casino. **I'm giving you a sure why to beat the house.** Currently, an ATM option for JANUARY 2022 is $1.75. This is cheap, folks. Real fucking cheap. I've got options that have been fucking printing since December. If you're a real tendie tickler, try leap call spreads. Set and fucking forget. [For the price of 4 GME shares, LUMN could net you $25k](http://opcalc.com/rlE). That's definitely enough to tell your wife's bf you're sleeping at the foot of the bed instead of a couch. In a year.

**Act 5: Don't Eat the Crayons**

Ok time for some chart astrology you fucks. As you can see [here,](https://imgur.com/YvMsoZy) we've got LUMN on the 10, hourly, and daily charts. For you robinhooders out there, there are things called candle sticks and technical indica-...fuck, nevermind. It's too complicated. Just keep yoloing your stimmies into GME FD's. It'll work out I promise. TBH it probably will you degenerates are a wild bunch. I hope you all make millions.

Anyhoo:

* The 10 is showing relative consolidation, with an arguable inverted head and shoulders, and had a strong move upward when RSI traded into the oversold range. there were multiple tests of the 200 EMA (purplish), 50 EMA, (yellowish), and 20 EMAS today in this time frame. LUMN held VWAP until about 10AM central when it dumped below it and traded under VWAP until it spiked up to retest VWAP after hours. A push over VWAP ($13.68) in PM tomorrow could set LUMN up for a strong pump at open for all you daytraders out there. MACD ended in the bullish/nuetral territory.
* Hourly is showing signs of a reversal if we can get strong out of the gate and get through the several levels of resistance: $13.19 at 200 EMA, $13.68 at VWAP, $13.73 at 20 EMA and $13.76 at the 50 EMA. RSI is still in the low to nuetral oversold territory at 45.50. MACD is getting ready to curl bullish and I think LUMN will be strong tomorrow. Volume Profile (not pictured) has strong resistance at $13.83, but over that we could get real fiesty.
* Despite the daily MACD curling bearish, and RSI being in the higher range of overbought, I'd argue we're seeing a small bull flag on the daily. Volume movement also makes me think bull flag, but be aware of the general market sentiment and get ready to play both sides of the coin.

&#x200B;

Ok Autists, you may be missing a chromosome, or might have an extra, or maybe I'm thinking of something totally different, but this one's a no brainer for me. Watch the price action and go long when the opportunity arises. Since my last post, LUMN experienced a sympathy squeeze from GME which drove the price up to $16.60. Since I'm no u/deepfuckingvalue, I cashed the fuck out of most of my earlier posted calls because I paid pennies for them and sold them for dollars. However, I still hold July, November and January 2022/2023 calls and spreads.

This is a smart play folks. Which might be sacrilege on WSB these days, but nothing will be unVALEd or turn PRPL in your portfolio and you will be able to afford to eat more than CORN. The only thing that will happen if you join the LUMN gain is green tendies and fucking caviar. #ganggang.

&#x200B;

Curaleaf ($CURLF) just crushed quarterly earnings and as far as I can tell, no other company is even close;

Total Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was a record $230.3 million, an increase of 205.1% compared to $75.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Total Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased 26.2% sequentially.

This is mostly because of their thirsty executive team re-investing their profits to expand to every state possible in the US.  They also just recently announced a European acquisition making them only one of 2 companies legally selling in the two largest markets in the world with ambitions of also opening up in Africa as well.

They are already the biggest company in the US, will soon be the biggest in the world.

One of the other issues facing the US industry as a whole is banking.  Because weed is still illegal, most companies have a hard time renting or purchasing spaces.  If the owner of the building has a mortgage with Wells Fargo or JP Morgan, the building is basically unavailable.  This is why cannabis REITS have been crushing it this year.  The Senate Majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has recently rekindled the idea about passing the SAFE act.  This would allow these companies to use major banks if they are in legal states.  Besides the fact that this would enhance their ability to set up shop around the US, think about what this could mean for companies looking to go global like Curaleaf.

I don't know if legalization is around the corner, but frankly I don't care.  Regardless of what government does, Curaleaf is going to find a way to move their product around the world and own the market.  If the government does move towards legalization, moving onto any US based cannabis company will be a good play.

EDIT 2:  $MO (Altria/Phillip Morris) owns logistics in this space and they already sell tabacco through multiple delivery methods.  They are traded on the NYSE already and have a solid stock buy back and good dividends.  If legalization gets to the point were it can be sold in gas stations, think of the return.  MO has a bigger market cap than any other company but ORTEX gives them a lower PE and EPS ( $MO EPS 2.40 P/E 10.21; $CURLF ($CURA on CSE) P/E 210.98 EPS 25.97) and my guess is because of debt and the lawsuits they will be paying out until time ends.  Analyst return recommendations on Ortex also have a higher 12 month return potential for CURLF/CURA (%25 vs. %2.9).  With that being said, MO is not selling weed to scale but when they do the growth can be explosive.  My one year play is still $CURLF but I will be hedging with $MO.

**Background:**

I'm going to be talking about eXp World Holdings Inc ($EXPI). EXPI provides many products, but most notably their cloud brokerage firm, eXp realty. Per yahoo finance: ""eXp operates as a cloud-based real estate brokerage firm. It focuses on the development and use of cloud-based technologies in order to grow an international brokerage without the burden of physical brick and mortar offices and redundant staffing costs. The firm offers offers software subscriptions to customers to access its virtual reality software platform through VirBELA.""

The stock has seen a 52 week range of $3.26 - $90.00 and is currently sitting at $52.00 after hours post earnings (up ~13% on the day). Their market cap is right about 6B.


**Earnings:**

They absolutely crushed earnings, some notable details:

- Revenue increased 122% from Q4 2019 -> Q4 2020, with the result of a record high - $609.3 million
- 15% increase in agents and brokers on the platform in Q4 2020 compared to Q3
- A record annual net income of $31 million

**The juicy deets:**

Ok, so now we have the background and some numbers, let's see why this is such an attractive stock. The competitors of EXPI include players like; Redfin (RDFN) - 7.91B market cap and Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) - 8.96B market cap.

Both of those are at least 1.5 billion more in market cap, with technology that is far behind what eXp is offering. Traditional real estate brokerages can't even be taken seriously when comparing, because they lack the technology side of things that EXPI offers. Hell, EXPI literally owns a VR platform for creating 3D virtual office environments. Which that part of their business is not even remotely being reflected in their stock price. 

It's more fair to compare EXPI to the tech startups that are upwards of 10B market cap. Looking at it from that perspective, we see a 4 billion dollar upside. Or a share price of ~$71.

That share price of $71 falls right into the 52 week range I stated at the beginning of the post and is what I consider an accurate value for this stock. The technical analysis from myself and others clearly shows this price target forming:

https://ibb.co/dL6brDg

https://ibb.co/Sx16QGx

RSI and MACD are both turning up after a long downtrend from the ATH (90 -> ~35). It found support around 40 and has bounced off of that up to $45 leading into earnings, which as stated before, were excellent. That caused the price to blow past the breakout area of ~51-52 during the AH session. 

This ship is headed for $70 very soon. It is certainly not going to be a GME type event where a 1500% return is seen, but a 40-50% gain on a company with good financials and future is something I certainly won't miss. 

I'm not a financial adviser, I just like the stock. 

Position: 61 shares @ $45

Edit: I've got a couple questions in comments and dm's about the bear case. Adding my take on this here. 

Bear case - 

Market writes them off as a traditional real estate brokerage, e.g. doesn't account for (or simply doesn't care about) the value add that EXPI brings to the table. In that case, EXPI is overvalued at $50 and true share price is around $30-$40. 

I highly disagree with that view point, obviously, but that's the perspective I'd take if I was in a short position.

They'll need to continue to show growth on their cloud platform(s) to invalidate the above thesis. This most recent earnings was a great example of them invalidating the short thesis by showing 15% growth on their cloud brokerage platform and record revenue numbers.

Double edit:

You beautiful autists who picked up shares and calls during the morning dips are true retards. Some of you are already looking at 100%+ gainz.

Triple edit:

Interest rate volatility is fucking us. I sold off at $59 for some quick gainz and bought back in at $46. Positions now are 20 shares @ ~$46 and 10 4/16 $60c @ 1.50 strike.

The fastest I've seen them implement rules in the past was one month from proposal... So, if they really want this... March 18th is likely the soonest. 

The implications of the new rule have been widely debated but I think it is fair consensus to say that it will require market participants to post more collateral as their underlying positions becoming more risky and/or require settlement. It will mean a lot of HFs under water can't just double down and hide in the 21 day liquidity cycle. The GME fiasco unveiled a lot of systemic risk to the system which is why they cut our tendies off.  


After this rule passes it's entirely likely the short-interest players change forever and there will never be another GME situation where any one fund takes such incredibly risk. It will be a healthy change for the markets.   


Now as hedge funds DO NOT KNOW when this rule will be implemented it is very likely we are seeing some aggressive covering for the smart players that do not want to be crowded out in the event of a surprise date. The implementation date is not likely to be the tipping point... It will probably be much sooner.   


OK let's look at how our stonks are doing:  


**$GME**  


https://preview.redd.it/d0pbsl9wuhm61.png?width=1737&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d4e84906ffc0020411419c541040a5a8ff941ae

Gamestop is in the midst of a massive shift to eCommerce and what's so amazing about this entire story is we have a massively over-shorted company AND a very likely turn around story. The market doesn't understand the potential of GME. This price action is not just about a squeeze, it's about defining the company as a multiple of sales (which is how other eCom companies are valued). In this instance eCom companies are getting 5-15 multiples of SALES. Gamestop also is living in a RAPIDLY EXPANDING MARKET and being led by a young, successful and capable leader Ryan Cohen. Short squeeze aside current market cap of GME is $18B at $250 a share. At $5B a year in sales as an eCom company that's a valuation of $50B on the LOW SIDE... This already supports a $500 share price in itself. I absolutely believe Gamestop can pull this off.   


The BEST part of this story was that DFV and Reddit WERE RIGHT about this massively undervalued company! Turns out retail investors aren't dumb- they're just retarded.  


**$BB**

  


https://preview.redd.it/dqkb0fgxvhm61.png?width=1742&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba4cc2b236e1e13ea4267fda849fd645175fe312

  
Blackberry is another amazing retail find. With a market cap of only $6 billion it's shaping up to be at the center of the internet-of-things electric vehicle. They're announcing partnerships out of their ying-yang and are looking to be the android for EV vehicles with their IVY platform. The reason they are not trading higher is because they have not demonstrated revenue growth to the street and big funds need that to buy in. That's OK because it gives everyone else a massive early buying opportunity. What's more is the chart is starting to show considerable support under $11. After $11 for March 12th and Marth 19th we have a huge amount of options ready to be triggered.   


This thing is kindling waiting to go up... It will just take a few visionary buyers (\*cough cathie\*) to set this abaze. 

**$AMC**  


&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0ddftvhhwhm61.png?width=1734&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ed93079ebaf09f18de13df5b1885e4b6f48225f

Check out THIS AMAZING trending chart action. AMC is ready to go UP! The shorts thought AMC would be a nice casuality of the pandemic and then reddit swarmed in to save the day. Turns out people like going to the movies. They just had a better-than-expected earnings call too and guess what... They have $1B in cash.   


AMC president said they have literally a year of block-buster amazing movies queued up to keep us buying over priced popcorn every day of the week. And guess what... I'm tired of watching movies from my couch. People realize theatres are awesome and it's the #2 American thing to do besides go out to eat (which you need to do).   


Short story is the options chain on this and momentum is undeniably strong. This is ready to go to $20.  


Once again Reddit is actually right about a great up and coming company!

&#x200B;

**$NOK**  


&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b68wv2yywhm61.png?width=1734&format=png&auto=webp&s=f77bffa42e18cadca0f45da7330c3eb2837b68ff

The chart of Nokia is a chart of incredible sadness. Kudos to any Nokia investor. But where there is a dark-horse there is an under-dog story. Turns out Biden and his team aren't big fans of China Tech and with US leadership we're seeing anti-China tech policies emerge. Eric Schmid of Google says 5G dominance in the US is a must and will require massive investment to ensure the US has the next generation internet companies ready to compete on a world scale. So far domestically China is way ahead with their deployment of 5G meaning the Chinese are going to invest hardcore in creating these new 5G companies. The world is changing.  


[Now that Biden is done with stimulus his next plan is infrastructure.](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/)Do you know what a big part of his infrastructure plan will be? 5g.   


* **Expanding broadband, or wireless broadband via 5G, to every American** – recognizing that millions of households without access to broadband are locked out of an economy that is increasingly reliant on virtual collaboration. Communities without access cannot leverage the next generation of “smart” infrastructure. As the COVID-19 crisis has revealed, Americans everywhere need universal, reliable, affordable, and high-speed internet to do their jobs, participate equally in remote school learning and stay connected. This digital divide needs to be closed everywhere, from lower-income urban schools to rural America, to many older Americans as well as those living on tribal lands. Just like rural electrification several generations ago, universal broadband is long overdue and critical to broadly shared economic success.

  
The leaders in the world for 5G technology are Ericcson, Nokia and Hawuii. Ericcson has a market cap of 2x Nokia for no good reason.   


**Nokia is about to get noticed in a big way... Oh and there are 140,000... yes THOUSAND... call contracts at $5 on March 18th.** 

Once again Reddit is actually right about a great up and coming company! Do you see a theme here?  


**$RKT**  


  


https://preview.redd.it/iotagb80yhm61.png?width=1743&format=png&auto=webp&s=af2f53adc4d033c7c170acabe44fedcff3446433

Rocket IPOd in September 2020 and has been controlled by the shorts ever since. Check out this chart of amazing disappointment. Every time something good happened to RKT like their earnings blowing expectations by 100% they were strangled down again.   


The truth is RKT is a best in class fin-tech disruptor with 9% of the mortgage market and a bunch of future loan-related services on the way. They also made $10 BILLION in profit and are only valued around $50 billion.   


Lately people were all worried about rising interest rates but the [CEO says to calm the fuck down because either way they're banking boat loads of money.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-ceo-downplays-rising-153042831.html)  


Short interest, depending on who you ask, is still around 30%. Oh and check out the open call interest for March 19th:  


https://preview.redd.it/4vh0y0dnyhm61.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=e97f92f92aa7fe9f2dccf89c057ea12bfb18651f

This options chain is what I call a feed-back-happy-day because as the $30 strike is triggered it will drive all the way up to the $50s... This thing is LOADED.  


Once again Reddit has found a great under-valued company with it's price suppressed for months and a loaded options chain ready to take this to the moon. RKT is absolutely my favorite for short term potential if GME is too seemingly expensive for you to enter. RKT price is totally low and you won't regret buying.

\*\*\*  


**TLDR:**  
There are SOME AMAZING coming catalysts that will increase the momentum on all these stocks. The reason they are moving is because Reddit is RIGHT! There is serious under-value here.

Tomorrow is going to be a good indicator on whether or not the Tech market is rebounding to its year long trend, or continuing to fall. If we see a good day, or just a light sell-off, I think we may have more clear skies ahead. Since there’s a lot of unknowns though. we’re going to stick with a strong growth stock that isn’t all that inflated. 

For those of you who didn’t sell XLE or ERX today, don’t stress, it’s still a strong position that I’m holding. If oil rises or holds tonight, think there’s a good chance XLE see’s a strong day tomorrow or early next week 

Now regarding the free money with JD. It’s time to buy the dip on this. I’m recommending ITM calls [75-85 strike] expiring late April. This is just my recommendation for a good combination of upside potential and risk control. This is also a great company for leaps or stock. Hoping for a down day tomorrow to swoop up some calls. 

JD is the sleeper E-Commerce giant of China. (Though it has a reach in many markets) Most people know it’s competitor Alibaba, but I can assure you, JD is a fucking Titan. They are on-track to taking a lot of market share from Alibaba in a densely populated market. 

JD has the best optimized supply chain in China’s E-Commerce market. They’ve spent a lot more time the past decade mastering the supply chain prior to pushing for growth, but I assure you that growth is here. JD has a number of subsidiaries, they all see huge growth, and most importantly they all make money. Alibaba posts a number of losses with its failed or poor performing subsidiaries, and will never overtake JD on supply chain performance. The fact they perform so well, and have entered both new and innovative markets and succeeded, just shows the strength of their management and future. 

I track a lot of institutional purchase points on stocks. The most recent filings show the 80-90 point range on JD as a major purchasing point. We also saw much less of a sell off on some of the final days the S&P posted major losses once in this range, further validating the price floor. 

JD is trading below all targets, and has strong institutional backing. 

JD just posted Q4 results, and as always at open we say a unprecedented sell-off this morning. This has become a regular thing for some unknown reason, which is why I don’t ever hold through earnings. It’s a gamble with no logic these days. I do look for these post-earnings drops in solid companies though, because they provide great buy points. JD beat expectations in all categories for Q4. JD’s revenue is up over 30% from last year to 34 Billion this quarter. I straight up laugh reading through their earning calls, it’s fucking unreal how much growth they see from a financial and user activity standpoint. 

A lot of analysts love saying how it’s just the CV-19 situation that has primarily driven its growth, and that afterwards a large portion of this growth will fall off. They’re fucking idiots. The market in China is huge, we might see a slight drawback, but you don’t stop this type of growth, especially in the Chinese market. It’s just now becoming normal for the lower class in China to have cellphones, opening up a huge market, and the entire country knows who JD is, including the poors and the olds. Want to know why? JD was used by the Chinese government to distribute aid through their applications and services. It’s was essentially a free, government endorsed, country wide PR and marketing opportunity that no ad could ever beat. It also targets the market they want to reach. Can’t make this shit up. 

Have fun with your free money. 

Notes for comments: I don’t provide sell points. The longer you hold, the more risk you take on. The expiration is for risk control only, it’s not the date I’m recommending to sell.

JD just posted Q4 results, and as always at open we say a unprecedented sell-off this morning. This has become a regular thing for some unknown reason, which is why I don’t ever hold through earnings. It’s a gamble with no logic these days. I do look for these post-earnings drops in solid companies though, because they provide great buy points. JD beat expectations in all categories for Q4. JD’s revenue is up over 30% from last year to 34 Billion this quarter. I straight up laugh reading through their earning calls, it’s fucking unreal how much growth they see from a financial and user activity standpoint. 

A lot of analysts love saying how it’s just the CV-19 situation that has primarily driven its growth, and that afterwards a large portion of this growth will fall off. They’re fucking idiots. The market in China is huge, we might see a slight drawback, but you don’t stop this type of growth, especially in the Chinese market. It’s just now becoming normal for the lower class in China to have cellphones, opening up a huge market, and the entire country knows who JD is, including the poors and the olds. Want to know why? JD was used by the Chinese government to distribute aid through their applications and services. It’s was essentially a free, government endorsed, country wide PR and marketing opportunity that no ad could ever beat. It also targets the market they want to reach. Can’t make this shit up. 

Have fun with your free money. 

Notes for comments: I don’t provide sell points. The longer you hold, the more risk you take on. The expiration is for risk control only, it’s not the date I’m recommending to sell.

UPDATE: We got a great entry point today on JD. As predicted all analysts are raising price targets.","FMA [9]: JD.Com ($JD) - ITM [75-85] Strike Call, EXP 4/23",m34odl,110,31,0.81,31,0,,DD,False,True,-1

1615507549.0,RAVN,"Hi cock suckers and carpet munchers. We’ve all been hearing about the recovery plays in oil, infrastructure, casinos, restaurants and so on. The one I have not been hearing about as much is the big recovery as it relates to the agriculture stonks. Figured I would give you all a few more ideas to chew on. 

The last few years have been absolute shit for farmers, with many of them going bankrupt or barely scraping by. Some of this is due to poor environmental conditions, some of it was trade war related, and the pandemic compounded all of those already existing problems. 

Where we are now - shit is getting back on track. A lot of this has to do with China and their need to rebuild their pork population. For those who don’t know, Chinese pigs got fucked by a quiet pandemic in 2019 - African Swine Fever. This causes them to buy a lot of soybeans and corn to feed all those fuckin pigs, sending the futures flying. We had a corn gang a little while ago, but this is now spreading to the rest of the farm. 

USDA is projecting a record number of acres to be planted this year in response to the demand, and with the Chinese showing no signs of slowing down, in addition to the volatile weather wiping out crops at random, farmers need to keep production higher as well. China is essentially back in full force post pandemic, and the US is just really starting to see the first signs of normalcy. This only adds to the demand and for different kinds of crops. 

On a separate note, there is a rediscovery of the outdoors and personal farming has been taking off. The booming weed industry can also give the general farming industry a boost as that will require all of the same inputs. 

Things like farming equipment, fertilizers, etc. are in high demand. There isn’t one specific way to play this so I will list a few solid names from each category. Some of these stocks have run up, but let’s be real - what fucking hasn’t at this point? This is a cyclical boom in all things farming that can last for a very long time.

Positions- 

My personal position is selling MOS puts, because I hate sucking theta dick with my butt and there have been extremely bullish options flow/high liquidity in the chain. 

Equipment - DE, CAT, AGCO, RAVN (also loved by cathie bae)

Fertilizers/chemicals - BG, MOS, NTR, CTVA, SMG, CF

General - ADM, DBA (don’t love DBA as a futures based ETF for reasons beyond the scope of the post, but you can see why with a simple search)

Dramatically increased issues with China, weaker recovery than expected, more volatile weather than is typically expected are factors that can hurt this overall play. Oh yea, almost forgot 🚀 🚀 🚀 🌙 🌙 🌙.",Farm Gang,m34j47,37,17,0.66,17,0,,DD,False,True,-1

1615503829.0,PT,"**TLDR**: iStar owns $2.5B of SAFE shares, $3.1B in other assets yielding 8% (3.2B of debt which costs 4%), yet a *market cap of $1.3B*.  iStar should trade 2x from here, with a few possible catalysts that could get some attention.

# Summary

iStar (STAR) is a REIT in transition moving assets to their ground leasing company called SAFE. There is a massive mispricing between the two intertwined companies. **iStar's market cap is $1.3B yet owns $2.5B worth of SAFE** *and* **$3.1B worth of assets yielding 7.9%.** As of Q4, there was only $50M of non-performing assets. This is trading at nearly an 80% discount!

# iStar’s SAFE investment ($2.5B):

iStar created the ground leasing company SAFE in 2017, which is a REIT that owns ground leases, not buildings. There is already a lot written about SAFE, so I'm not going to summarize that; instead I'll focus on the mispricing. iStar owns 34.8M shares of SAFE currently valued at $2.5B ($73 / share)( [Slide 11](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008) ). Based solely on iStars SAFE holding, **iStar should trade at $34.25 a share**($2.5B of SAFE/ 74M iStar shares outstanding).

Is SAFE legit? Goldman thinks so with a recently initiated $101 price target (Jan 2021), with a street average of $90 a share. If SAFE reached Goldman’s PT, this would translate to an iStar holding of $3.5B in SAFE. Based on **Goldman’s SAFE Price target**, **iStar should trade at $47.10** a share, some 268% where it trades now.

At this point, the mispricing is so stark that **if you bought $73 of iStar** (i.e. 1 share of SAFE), you would get ***1.93 shares of SAFE***\*, plus iStar’s other underlying assets worth some $3B in other assets

# iStar’s Other Assets($3.1B):

iStar breaks out their other lines of business into three buckets:

* Net Lease Consolidated Assets: $2.162B yielding 7.9% ([Slide 12](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008), Q4 report)
* Net Lease Venture II: 300M yielding 9% ([Slide 13](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008), Q4 report)
* Real Estate Finance Portfolio: $646M at 7.2% ([Slide 15](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008), Q4 report).

In total, they have only $52M of non-performing assets. These assets total **$3.1B yielding 7.9%.**

# iStar’s Liabilities ($3.2B):

iStar is a REIT, so leverage is the name of the game. Debt, net of cash is $3.2B meaning if iStar disposed on their ""Other Assets"" they would be net neutral. The times iStar has offloaded assets, they received far more than what their book indicated [Link](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/istar-announces-the-completion-of-the-sale-of-its-preferred-freezer-net-lease-assets-300878208.html). iStar wouldn't do that as the cost of debt is \~4% while they are yielding some 8%. This debt is \~1.1x leveraged when including SAFE.  

# Upcoming catalysts:

I strongly feel it's a matter of time before the market realizes this massive price discrepancy. Here are some possible events:

* **Goldman initiated coverage on SAFE on January 27th, 2021**. Why not cover iStar if they own 63% of SAFE?
* Three major assets of iStar are Asbury Park, Magnolia Green and Grand Vista. They are looking sell these off over the next 2 years. This would be a massive cash event that could trigger a large iStar share repurchase program or make a move private more seamless.
* iStar has been trying to simplify its message by selling off legacy (though high quality) assets. iStar is nearly complete with this process and plans to begin messaging this year
* SAFE x STAR One-Stop Capital Program was launched in Q4. This combines deals that allow companies to ground lease through SAFE, then allow iStar to offer financing. This could offer some additonal topline growth and further prove their business model is scalable and synergistic between iStar and SAFE going forward.

There is a lot of information already out on iStar and SAFE. I'm a big believer in the SAFE and iStar business models, though my intention here is to highlight the massive price discrepancy between the two stocks.

EPS: 1.363 ; PE: 18.35

BVPS: 11.18 ; PB: 2.237

What other company in this space trades at similar numbers. $FL does (18.45, 2.118). Thats a good sign, its trading like a company with twice the market cap. The difference being $ASO is regional and $FL (inter?)national. I see this as a bonus to the side of $ASO. It can focus more on the unique aspects of its customers and capitalize on *cough* guns *cough* those products. Contrarily, to the side of $FL, it does have a 1.4% dividend yield that is built into the price as well. 

Next question to ask is how well they have transitioned to the online economy that has dominated 2020 and will dominate in the non distant future? Introducing new board member Tom Nealon. Currently president of Southwest Airlines and previously served as EVP, CIO of JC Penney, (*record scratch* wait the JCPenney that got shat on by the pandemic? Oh no. . . lets keep reading.) from 2006 to 2010. *phew* dodged a bullet there. So it seems like he's actually good at his job and not a monke 🐵. With that being said it seems like they've already done better than your average brick and mortar during the pandemic, they have beat earnings in Q3 and I think they will again in Q4.

So now that we have reason to believe it's properly priced and there's room to grow from here lets get to the fun part. This stock is a time bomb, we hear it beeping but the LCD screen broke so we cant see the time left. Its 40% short and the shorts have been continuing to short as the price increases, hmm I've seen this one before. We will probably see 45-50% short on the next report date. 

There's no guaranty anything will squeeze. But at some point in the future the stock will be overpriced which means tendies and if it does squeeze, a lot of them. It will need a catalyst to squeeze but either way its a good investment

In this edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we’ll be taking a look at why the 10-year interest rate is important, how it has led to rising asset prices over the past few decades (i.e. creating an asset bubble), and how GME is involved with all of this.

[Ray Dalio’s Thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhrkwu/a_smooth_brained_guide_to_ray_dalios_thesis/)

**What is the 10-year US treasury and why is the yield so important?**

The 10 year treasury is an IOU sold by the US government when it needs to borrow money, promising to pay it back in 10 years with regular interest payment in the meantime. They auction off these bonds to the highest bidder, and the price that these bonds get sold off at determines the yield of these bonds. In finance, US bonds are considered to be a risk-free asset, since it’s the safest possible investment anyone can make (at least in theory). Because of this, the 10 year US bond yield is considered to be the “risk free rate” for any long-term investments and acts as gravity towards any other riskier investments.

**Why does the 10-year affect the price of every other asset?**

As a rule of thumb, the riskier an asset is, the higher return (or yield) that asset will need to provide. For things like bonds, are pretty straight-forward - it’s the yield, or effective interest rate that bond provides. For things like equities (stocks), it’s a bit more complicated. As a hand-wavy approach, a lot of people use Earnings, so let’s go with that. % return demanded by investors = earnings / price, meaning price is inversely proportional to % return, or **if % return demanded 📈 price 📉** **and vice versa**.

This is how the treasury yields affect the price of literally everything else (except GME), from real estate to SPY. Suppose that JPow decided overnight that he changed his mind and managed to pump up the 10-year rate to 10%, which is where it was at for most of the 1980s. Compared to SPY, which is maybe giving you a return of 2.5% (based on the current PE ratio of 40), any 🦍 with more than two brain cells can figure out the better deal. So everyone sells their SPY and loads up on treasuries until SPY drops enough (i.e. falls 75%) to at very least match the return of the 10-year, and likely even more due to the increased risk and volatility (risk premium).

[S&P 500 Earnings Yield vs. 10Y Treasury Yield](https://preview.redd.it/pg68b4n39hm61.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=457e43c3379aa0cef7424de824904d2c8f66e556)

There’s several other mechanisms that this rate affects various asset prices as well

1. Housing prices - For the same reasons, a rise in the 10-year = a rise in mortgage rates. So if the prime mortgage rate doubles from 3% (today) to 6%, to buy the same $250K house, a 30-year mortgage will go from a $1000 monthly payment to a $1500 monthly payment, which might be more than what people looking at $250K houses can afford. This would thus cause a decline in housing prices until the people who would’ve previously bought those houses can afford it again.
2. Stock buybacks - A low 10-year = low corporate bond yields = incentivizes businesses to take on the cheap debt, even if they don’t need it. What do they do with that excess capital? Usually, stock buybacks or dividend payments, which drives up their own stock prices - something executives are especially incentivized to do since their compensation is usually tied to stock price performance. What happens when the 10-year and corporate bond interest rates go back up? Those companies who took on a bunch of debt probably won’t refinance their bonds when they expire, and will need to divert their resources from dividend and stock buybacks to paying down their debt, possibly even issuing more shares to raise capital to pay it back, lowering their stock price.
3. Leverage - Treasury rates set the bar for the lowest interest rates someone can borrow at, including hedge funds to borrow cash to buy stocks on margin. To dumb it down, if a hedge fund finds some combination of trades that yield a 5% return with low risk and can borrow from their broker at 2%, they could lever up 10x (theyre not subject to the 2x leverage limit retail investors have) and get a 50% return while paying 20% in interest. What happens when treasury rates go up, causing their interest rates they pay to their brokerage go up? They sell those holdings, and since most funds are net-bullish on the market, this usually means a mass sell-off in the stock market.

**How the Fed controls the 10-year yield**

The Fed’s official mission is to

1. Ensure price stability, this usually means that they target a 2% inflation rate
2. Try to achieve “full employment”, which is basically the lowest unemployment rate that's practically achievable

They achieve this through two mechanisms.

1. The Fed Funds Rate - This is what they use during normal times. This is basically the interest rates the banks within the Federal Reserve System lends to each other overnight, which they can set a ceiling and floor to by establishing a rate that any bank can borrow or lend the Fed at any time
2. Quantitative Easing / Tightening - This is an unconventional tool they usually resort to once the Fed Funds Rate reaches zero (for Easing) to further stimulate the economy to further pump liquidity by directly buying Treasuries / government bonds, and sometimes other assets like Mortgage Backed Securities and Corporate Bonds.

It’s pretty obvious from above how the Fed can affect the 10-year note, especially with quantitative easing, where they might directly buy it, causing the price to decrease from an increased demand and reducing the yield as a result.

**What Happened Last Week**

So what happened with the 10-year yield last week? It **🚀 🌝**, which for reasons mentioned above, means that everything else **📉.**

[10Y Treasury Yield, Daily](https://preview.redd.it/luroj2b79hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ad89ea67d4e86e555d39008d51d5cdc8fa8ec0d)

*Why did the 10-year yield* ***🚀 🌝***\*?\*

Basically, there was a lot of speculation recently that we might see inflation as the economy opens up.

*Why does the economy reopening = inflation?*

There’s this macroeconomic theory called the Quantity Theory of Money - ***MV = PQ***, where M is the quantity of Money in the system, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the GDP. A rise in P = inflation.

In this equation, the key variable is the velocity of money, which is the speed at which money circulates in an economy, or in other words, how fast consumers will spend a dollar once they earn it. Interestingly enough, ever since the 2000s, and especially after the 2008 recession, velocity of money has been steadily declining, mostly due to rising income inequality as richer people tend to spend money less quickly than poorer people who might be living paycheck to paycheck. However, when COVID hit, it really 📉 fast.​

[Velocity of M2 Money](https://preview.redd.it/j7mi0ed99hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=34d61275d0dc17bfbd82e6a16c3dc7beb1751a0e)

So with Q (GDP) and M (Money Supply) being equal, this would generally mean P going down as well, or in other words, deflation - the Fed’s worst nightmare. How do central banks combat this? By increasing M proportionally to the decrease in V.

[M2 Money Stock](https://preview.redd.it/hdg62w7b9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=78de5d86fb81951af79939159662a0a442dc28dc)

*By what mechanism does the Fed increase M?*

Using the two mechanisms described above. Right when COVID hit, they immediately dropped the Fed Funds Rate to 0. They quickly realized that wasn’t enough, and started buying government and corporate bonds on-mass until they were confident it would prevent deflation. This has the side-effect of decreasing the 10-year yield, and making all other assets go up. If you look closely, though you’ll see that they really turned off the printing press after the summer.

So, what happens when the economy opens back up? V goes up, maybe back to normal. So the Fed has two options according to the Quantity Theory of Money

1. Let M (money supply) stay where it is. This means that P will go up, or in other words, inflation
2. Prevent inflation by decreasing M. This will have the opposite effect of what was described above, and sending the 10-year yields 📈 and all asset prices **📉**

[Fed Balance Sheet](https://preview.redd.it/h9buyb8g9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=33fe1010414625a0fa585b18d144d4a396ec86ee)

*What did JPowell say?*

He basically confirmed what everyone was thinking - **inflation is coming**. However, he did say that he was comfortable letting inflation go above its 2% target until jobs recover and the Fed achieves its second mandate - full employment.

*Why did what he say cause yields to go up regardless?*

Basically, people were expecting him to announce that he was going to turn the money printer back on and increase the number of treasury purchases to force the 10-year yield back down. He did not do that, which indicates that he’s changing his stance to actually try to be careful to not overheat the economy, and that he might actually be worried about inflation since he went against what the entire market assumed he would do, and priced in to do.

At very least, this means that we probably shouldn’t be counting on the Fed’s money printer continuously driving up asset prices anytime soon. In the medium term, if inflation does get bad enough, it shows at least some willingness from the Fed that they may actually intervene and decrease the money supply - causing everything else to crash alongside it. Will it happen? Well that depends on how bad this inflation gets, and how bad the Fed is willing to stand by and watch it happen until they do something.

**Why I am a 🌈🐻 in the medium term**

The re-opening might force the Fed to do something that they haven’t done in a very long time - quantitative tightening.

If you look closely at these charts, you can put yourself in the shoes of the Fed and see why stonks only went 📈 in the past decade.

* The 2008 recession caused a permanent decline in velocity of money that has never actually really recovered - likely due to the increased income inequality that never reversed since then
* Decreased velocity of money = decreased P, or deflation, in the long term with all things equal
* To avoid this, the Fed drops the Fed Funds rate to 0, followed by quantitative easing on treasuries, dropping their yield as well, to increase the money supply to keep the inflation rate near their target
* Since velocity of money never really recovered, they just left the money they pumped in and the low interest rates they set at the 2008 recession there and barely touched it until 2017, where they slowly raised it until they abruptly stopped in 2018 - we’ll get to what happened when they did that in a bit
* With all this extra liquidity in the system keeping the 10-year low, when the economy did eventually recover from the 2008 recession, all asset prices, including the stock market and real estate prices **🚀 🌝** for virtually every year - except for 2018 - we’ll also get to that in a bit

**What Happened in 2018?**

[SPY, near 2018](https://preview.redd.it/efjhgufw9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e99c92f0e9f22bf26f2f8bf17e9c740021b6c27)

[Fed Funds Rate, near 2018](https://preview.redd.it/woz6w4ww9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e539f1f4ef0ea0a96a90e0c59dd766b603087ff1)

Throughout 2017, but especially in 2018, the Fed finally decided to slowly start increasing the Fed Funds rate back up from basically 0%, almost 10 years after the 2008 recession; the first quantitative tightening we’ve since then. So, what happened in 2018? First, the [yield curve inverted](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/the-us-bond-yield-curve-has-inverted-heres-what-it-means.html) (meaning the 10 year yield fell below the 3 month yield), possibly the most reliable forward indicator of an oncoming recession - in the past 50 years, every recession has happened within 2 years of a yield curve inversion, and every yield curve inversion has been followed by a recession within 2 years except for one false positive. This is usually a signal of lack of confidence in investors in asset prices, which in turn caused the stock market to crash, leading to one of the only >1% decline year in the S&P500 since 2009.

So my thesis for is that in the next few years, one of the following must happen

* Velocity of Money never recovers to pre-COVID levels. TBH this is probably the best case scenario for the stock market, but is probably REALLY bad for the economy. The only way for this to really happen is we remain in a K-shaped recovery, where we continue to have high-unemployment for lower paying jobs and high income inequality
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, the Fed either continues quantitative easing or does not do quantitative tightening. This will eventually lead to inflation well above the Fed’s 2% target. JPowell has shown so far that although he would accept this temporarily without doing any action but left the door open for quantitative tightening if he sees sustained over-inflation, which is possible (and imo likely) given the amount of money pumped into the economy over the year + how much the velocity of money dropped last year.
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, and the Fed decides to do some sort of quantitative tightening in the medium term after seeing sustained over-inflation. If this happens, we will find out how much of the last decade’s stock market gains were from real productivity increases, and how much of it was from the Fed’s monetary policy.

*What do I think? Short term, anything can happen so no I'm not buying SPY puts again. I am, however, not going long on anything outside of a 6 month time frame. Why? Ask yourself this - what do you really think has been the primary driver of the stock market's rise over the past decade: Fundamental economic growth? Or is it the Fed's money printing. Now, ask yourself, how long can that driver keep going for? The money printer was on overdrive the past few months to compensate for COVID; how long could this last until we see inflation and it forces JPowell to turn off the printer?*

***TLDR; Stonks only go 📈 if you have the Fed on your side. If the Fed ever decides (or needs to) changes sides, bulls r fucked***

**Why GME 🚀 🌝 when everything else 📉**

Not really related to the thesis, and [I briefly talked about this a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/), but it seems to be what everyone talks about nowadays so I guess I’ll talk about this too. I’m sure some of y’all have noticed that every time every other stock goes down, GME usually 📈 and vice versa, and especially wrinkly brained ape [did the math](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lteecj/gme_may_have_the_potential_to_dictate_the_course/) and found a statistically significant inverse correlation between GME and the rest of the stock market. Why is that? Well, in short

1. Virtually nobody buying GME now is doing so because of earnings yield / they did a DCF on the company and thought that it was undervalued at $50 based on future cash flows, so the 10-year yield increasing is meaningless to them
2. Institutions / Hedge Funds that are on the other side of the trade need to de-gross their books whenever the stock market goes down. In short, some hedge funds tend to take an insane amount of leverage (eg. the mean gross leverage of a hedge fund is around 8x right now). They can do this because their “net exposure”, which is their long exposure - short exposure is much lower, and isn’t as risky because they are “hedged” vs. market conditions. Gross exposure, on the other hand, is the total value of long and short positions they hold. So, if they sell off a long position, they need to sell a short position if they’ve levered up in this way, and vice versa. It’s pretty well known that hedge funds love big tech stocks and like shorting AMC and GME. So, if they exit out of their tech / growth longs to reduce their gross leverage, they’ll also need to cover their GME shorts as well.

Now for some DD. Some crossover from [u/Shandowarden](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shandowarden) 


What is Root? 

Root is a car insurance company, but also a data technology SaaS company.  Root requires drivers to download their mobile app that tracks driver behavior to inform the company how to rate your insurance. This is called telematics.  Before people start shitting on this company invading your privacy, hear me out. 
There are several states in the West that are proceeding with social injustice legislation to ban the usage of credit scoring within insurance rating.  See [OR](https://legiscan.com/OR/text/SB173/id/2236077) See [WA](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5010&Year=2021&Initiative=false) California already prohibits the use of credit scoring for auto policies.  

What does this mean? 

 Insurance companies rely on data to establish rates for all consumers.  If the state bans a specific rating factor (like credit score), the insurance companies will look to alternative data sources to increase granularity / provide competitive quotes for their consumers. ""Doesn't progressive already do this?"" Yes, the do; however, progressive is just one player in the game.  There are over 100 different insurance carriers in the West that write auto insurance, many of which are significantly smaller than the big boys.  In order to stay competitive, Root is going to serve as a necessary SaaS for the smaller insurance carriers to stay relevant / competitive.  

Alternatively, the bear scenario is that companies look to build this out themselves, which would lend Root to be a very attractive acquisition target. 

Root has very little debt: $209M

And lots of cash on hand: $1.1B in cash and cash equivalents, and $250M in cash / investments with its subsidiaries. This cash alone represents roughly 46% of the current ($2.8B) market cap. 

$LMND has a market cap of $6.3B (2/3rds of it's peak 3 months ago).  If $ROOT were to match that market cap of $6.3B (which arguably should be higher), we'd be looking around roughly $25 per share, let alone a short squeeze greater than GME... 

TLDR:  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀  ROOT is a tech based insurance company also selling SaaS via data and telematics.  Data is transforming the world, and the insurance industry is incredibly behind.  Data companies such as this one will be here to stay, if not acquired by other insurance companies.

1615498539.0,PT,"1. U.S. daily Covid cases are still on the decline (7-day average currently at 63.2k vs. a high of 259.6k at the start of the year)
2. I'm currently in IL and have been tracking the vaccine data, as of yesterday we are currently at 10.25% of the state fully vaccinated (more than 98.2M doses have been given in the US as a whole). I personally have started to go to the movies again (double-masking) and spent $20+ both times on overpriced concessions to help the company lol. As an AMC Stubs member I get half off on Tuesday's so that's cool I'm happy to do my part.
3. Theaters in Los Angeles are set to reopen this Saturday (not necessarily AMC, but any news of theaters opening up is positive for AMC in this context).
4. AMC seems to have made a deal with WarnerMedia. CEO Adam Aron said their deal would likely reslut in lower fees they will have to pay to rent movies from the studio, thus increasing their gross margin.
5. B. Riley raised their Price Target for AMC to $7.00/share, up from $5.50.
6. Wedbush raise their PT to $6.50/share, up from $5.00.
7. ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" comes out this month. I personally will be seeing it in theaters and again buying tendies/soda/candy before the movie starts.

I don’t do fundamental analysis.

You don’t build a company like $ABNB otherwise. That said... If I were to do some kind of “analysis” I would say... 

1. $ABNB just crushed earnings.
2. They handled the pandemic extremely well, like as good as any company really could. They basically did everything right. Got a $1billion loan, cut cost (they even cut exec pay across the board) and at the same time protected customers. I’m sure you had an Airbnb booked when the pandemic hit and got a full refund... just think about how shitty your experience was with canceling your airline tickets. They also launched a fund to reimburse hosts for cancelled stays and opened a fund to help hosts pay mortgages. Point is they handled a major crisis extremely well, which goes back to my point about capable leaders managing for growth.
3. Travel is going to explode this summer. I know every single one of you has a wedding or some kind of event booked every weekend from July 2021 to Dec 2022. Where are you going to stay... Marriott?

This stock reminds me of $TSLA. $ABNB is positioned to be the single largest travel company in the world and actually provide a great service.

🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀

So it's been a rough past few weeks since I did this original DD. I added more shares to cost average down further during the rough ride last week. The stock railed  yesterday on some good news about new services related to birthdays. Next catalyst is earnings on April 26, 2021.

My convictions about the stock haven't changed. What has changed is the current short interest. As of 2/26 (according to nasdaq) the short count was \~ 6 million shares, with approximately  28 million  shares floating. At the current daily volume of \~1 million shares, it would take short positions approximately 6 days to cover. That's six days to really fucked up some hedgies. New data drops today at 5ish.

I still believe in this stock, and imagine that the April earnings catalyst will put us in the high 30s/low 40s.

1615465418.0,EXPE,"It has become apparent through recent events that the fate of Citadel and Melvin Capital are inextricably linked.  One might even say Melvin Capital is a thinly veiled shell company for Citadel to spread its holding positions and reduce risk of full exposure.  

In the event of a catastrophic market event (GME mother of all short squeezes for example), Citadel and Melvin will be forced to liquidate their most valuable long positions.  For Melvin Capital, this would start with Expedia, their largest portfolio holding by percent and totaling $1.5B in current market value.  

https://preview.redd.it/uxctj2oi2em61.png?width=563&format=png&auto=webp&s=378c368c44c2dc85abff6ba29ba59697ca6f3176

&#x200B;

Interestingly enough, Expedia is currently trading at all-time historical highs near $170/share, with a recent nasty pullback in January of this year to $120 range.  Expedia average daily volume is only \~3.5 million, and a share float of 113 million.  This means Melvin Capital's total EXPE long position is 10% of the entire EXPE public share float.

If Melvin Capital were to suddenly divest a portion of its Expedia holdings, the short term price of EXPE would capitulate downward, potentially triggering other institutional holders to also reduce their EXPE exposure.  

I have nothing against Expedia, but their recent share price run up combined with an institutional de-levering event as proposed above could make for a significant pullback.",The De-levering of Citadel and Melvin Capital via $EXPE,m2oxn9,42,103,0.91,103,0,,Discussion,False,True,1

Alright, fuck this shit. You get the gist already. I'm pretty sure you've read this quote for the millionth time by now. I don't want to waste your time here.

I've compiled a shit list of all the bad guys whom you Gee Em Mee apes need to watch out for. Along with their names I will post their misdeeds and links to sources as evidence. This is by no means a comprehensive list and I will continue to edit/update it as soon as my team of fellow Gee Em Mee enthusiasts and I dig up more dirt and uncover more information on these shitheads that deserve nothing but scorn (but no death threats, please!).

Let's get to it.

**Gabe Plotkin (CEO of Melvin Capital)**: If you don't know who this guy is, then you're a massive idiot. Have you been living under a rock all this time? I don't think you should be investing in a stock whose fundamentals you don't understand quite clearly.Quick recap: Melvin is the bastard with the short position on Gee Em Mee.

Anyways, Gabe pulled the race card and made the absurd claim in his hearing [testimony](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/testimony-of-gabriel-plotkin-founder-of-melvin-capital-management/8882e0d9-a683-4392-bc2e-87e56ba43baf/) that he received messages on Reddit like “it’s very clear we need a second holocaust, the jews can’t keep getting away with this.”

**But that was proven to be false**: WSB mod [/u/zjz](https://www.reddit.com/u/zjz/) debunked this claim in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm7z47/gabe_plotkin_claims_many_wsb_posts_were_laced/gntr31f?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) . Also Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit aka [/u/spez](https://www.reddit.com/u/spez/) also debunked it during the hearings.

On January 31st, Gabe's ex-wife, Yaara, filed for divorce, citing ""irreconciliable difference.""

Rumors are floating around that the divorce was done on purpose to protect his assets.

&#x200B;

On March 3rd, CNBC reported that Melvin posted a [return](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/melvin-capital-posts-return-of-more-than-20percent-in-february-sources-say.html) of 21.7% in February. Yeah right. Getting back to CNBC later...

**Ken Griffin** (CEO of Citadel): Melvin's master. This prick is the one that is receiving your order flow data if you trade with any of these 9 [brokers](https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/02/citadel-is-paying-for-order-flow-from-nine-online-brokerage-firms-not-just-robinhood/).

Wait what? You thought only Robinhood was colluding with this bastard? Well think again and open your eyes. Look at their [quants](https://youtu.be/2u007Msq1qo). Just look at them. Notice anything different? Look at their monitors for Chrissakes.  These geeks got first place in their Math Olympiad contests. They can't even speak ape, goddamn it.

Back on January 26th, the Day of the Squozening, Citadel and his butt buddy Point 72 bailed out Melvin with a 2.75 billion dollar [injection](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-ken-griffin-invest-3-billion-gamestop-short-seller-2021-1-1030003305). Have fun being their bitch and doing their bidding for life, Melvin. lulz

[u/420redditpornacct69](https://www.reddit.com/user/420redditpornacct69/) has more dirt on this bastard right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7o2rq/know_thy_enemy_kenneth_c_griffin_the_barbarian/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

**Steve Cohen** (CEO Point72): Fat fuck rescued Melvin as mentioned in the above entry. Also a white collar [criminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cohen_(businessman)). Deleted his Twitter account because he was too chickenshit to deal with the trolls.

**Jim Cramer**: host of Mad Money/coke head/former hedge fund manager. I'm pretty sure you've seen this infamous short-and-distort [video](https://youtu.be/r07Gg92YjOI) that was not meant to be leaked. Works for CNBC, a shill media that is trying to divert our attention/sell the stock the apes oh so dearly love. Also:

[Dude can't shut the fuck up about Gee Em Mee.  Credits to GMEDD.com for the image.](https://preview.redd.it/gmtsgzbl6fm61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba6abe0fcebf291d701e7e5bb7f86a5fa9e2d876)

**CNBC**: shills whatever securities Melvin/Citadel and the rest of the shorts are holding. Silver/Es El Vee. Cee Cee Eye Vee/Lucid [(did you see that pump and dump on the 23rd of Feb? lmfao)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/811473329361518615/820083536433643550/chart.png) **(EDIT: That PnD happened exactly ONE DAY before GME spiked again on the 24th.  Coincidence?  Hmmm...)**. Rocket. Etc. etc. Talked shit about Reddit traders and [WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l54ky3/an_open_letter_to_cnbc/) for ages.

EDIT: [Along with MarketWatch, CNBC also reported the dip on GME early on March 10th.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m2n44x/webull_confirms_cnbc_article_about_gme_price_drop/)

**Leon Cooperman** (CEO of Omega Advisors): Another irrelevant old geezer and hedgie. Got busted for [insider trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Cooperman) back in 2016 and paid a hefty fine, but keeps denying any wrongdoing. Imbecile really has a habit of crying on live air like an baby. In this [video](https://youtu.be/mI-nItz56Fs) he warns the audience that the squeeze ""will not end well for the public"" and in this video right [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59xBSGe45gQ), he pleads with the media to ""not portray billionaires as criminals."" I can't make this shit up.

**Chamath Palihapitiya** (CEO of Social Capital): When he's not busy shilling his shitty SPACs and SoFi brokerage firm, this man child likes to post stupid shit on Twitter like "" Im about to really fuck some shit up...just fyi."" and douchy half-naked selfies with chicken legs.

Let's recap what this two-faced dumbass did:

1. [Bought $115 calls on GME on the 26th.](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354089928313823232?lang=en) Quickly cashed them out (paper hand snake), gave it to charity, and went onto CNBC to give himself a pat on the back and to ""defend"" Reddit investors and WSB. More like find support for his potential run for governor of California and his shitty SPACs, amirite? [Fuck shit up, lulz.](https://i.imgur.com/XKmCfQU.png)
2. Lambasted Robinhood for selling data to Citadel, when his SoFi brokerage firm does the exact same shit.According to Wikipedia: In early 2021, during the [GameStop short squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze), he repeatedly attacked [Robinhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinhood_(company)) and its founders for being unethical by selling payment for order flow to HFT firms like [Citadel Securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_LLC) and pushed his fans to switch over to [SoFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi), which was merging with his SPAC. [SoFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi) employs the same practice of selling payment for order flow to HFT firms (including to Citadel Securities) and owns a 16% stake in Apex Clearing Corp a clearing house involved in the controversy.[\[58\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamath_Palihapitiya#cite_note-58)[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamath_Palihapitiya#cite_note-59)[\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamath_Palihapitiya#cite_note-60)
3. Owns 16% stake in APEX. APEX is the clearing firm that prevented several brokers from allowing investors to purchase the meme stonks during the Squozening. More on that later...

**MarketWatch**: Hoo boy. This just happened today (March 10th, 2021), but man is the plot thickening or is the plot thickening? [At 11:55 AM EST, journalist Wallace Witkowski reported the dip on GME 25 FUCKING MINUTES before it began.](https://twitter.com/MrDavidNIO/status/1369733681259053061) Uh, SEC, you seeing this shit?

For the record, I believe the shorts pumped and dumped GME today to scare the paper hands into selling. It was still up 6% for the day. Oops.

**The following list of brokers who restricted purchase of the meme stonks during the Squozening (credit to** [**/u/CriticDanger**](https://www.reddit.com/u/CriticDanger/) **for compiling this list):**

1615442097.0,PS,"Hi WSB,

I decided to check out palantir and this is what I like:

&#x200B;

1. 120 billion TAM
2. Impressive DEMO day showcasing Gotham and Foundry
3. Recent partnership with AWS 
4. great Q4 earnings and they projected the revenue will grow to 4 billion by 2025
5. they are basically in the big data business which i do not see much competition, nobody is close to what they are doing
6. stamp of approval by Cathie Wood with the given massive buying. PLTR has 1.16% weightage in their portfolio

I've taken matters into my own hands and made a simple valuation model. My goal is to get a feel for how big palantir will be in 2025 and their share price target. 

* Alex karp said projected revenue will be 4b by 2025, which is a 30% growth rate.
* I think they will confidently hit 45% compounded annual growth rate, giving them revenue of 7 billion.
* what im stuck now is applying a PS ratio. assuming PS of 20, the market cap would be 105 billion. 
* at the time of writing, PLTR market cap is 43b, so we are expecting a 2.4 x increase? i think its quite impressive but maybe a bit overhyped? maybe my valuation is totally wrong and too pessimistic.
* im still excited about PLTR but just doing my due diligence. I'm open for any criticism or feedback. 

&#x200B;

this is my first time doing a valuation model so let me know what yall think. I know its kinda pointless crunching numbers because it would be inevitably wrong anyway (if it were correct all the time, i would have been rich by now lol). but at least it gives me a starting point to work on.

1615441995.0,TSLA,"Here’s an article about it:

https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-ge-is-doing-a-reverse-stock-split-and-what-it-means-for-you-11615391261

And here’s my take on it:

There is no innate reason why a stock split or reverse split would change the held value of a stock, it just changes share price and the amount of shares held/floated. That being said, last year we saw some big movement when popular companies (like TSLA for instance) did stock splits to reduce their share price. This had the effect of making these stocks more available to retail investors like us, which ended up causing prices to surge.

Now, could a reverse stock split work similarly? Well, no, because it’s putting shares further out of reach of the average retail investor. That being said, current share price of GE is around $14 so the new price would be around $112, which certainly isn’t ludicrously expensive. The thing that I’m most attracted to is the fact that this would have the effect of immediately cutting float by 87.5%.

Think about what’s happened with GME (similar ticker lulz). Basically we fucked the shorts by eating up all the float. When there’s not much float available, prices go up, and shorts get fucked and end up driving the price up further when they close out their positions. What I’m saying is if investors start buying up GE heavily up to the reverse split and/or even shortly after it, the float is going to get very limited, which could have the effect of pushing the price very high (supply and demand).

Anyway, I just like the stock. I’ve been playing it long for quite a while now and it’s been climbing very steadily over the past few months (new CEO seems to know his shit).

I was bored and curious as to how the dot com bubble popped so I looked into it and found this way too correlated to right now

>In February 2000, with the Year 2000 problem no longer a worry, Alan Greenspan announced plans to aggressively raise interest rates, which led to significant stock market volatility as analysts disagreed as to whether or not technology companies would be affected by higher borrowing costs.

So the fed hasnt came out and raised rates but mortgage companies are already raising rates and the broader repo market refusal to buy bonds are a bad sign. Smart money isnt dumb enough to buy inflation is only at 2.9% and it is showing in equities and real estate. Many analysts/fund managers have came out and said they expect repo rates to spike as high as 3% by the end of the year.


On tope of this even though its not rate hikes, they just fucking rekt any corporations paying execs over 1M and made sure to put into the stimmy 60B worth of tax hikes removing deductions for large corporations and the CNBC/Bloomberg channels havent said a fucking word even though this is kind of significant.

[Tax hikes snuck into stimulus bill](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/10/covid-relief-bill-tax-hikes-475051)

>On March 13, 2000, news that Japan had once again entered a recession triggered a global sell off that disproportionately affected technology stocks.

I mean what the absolute fuck. The writing is seems to be on the wall. Like this is so eerily similar to what happened in 2000.

I am more confident in the long term story than ever before and finally........ the company has come out and given us something to really listen to and to understand the 5 year narrative for purple's growth plan. There are no plays, just optimistic thoughts. 

I believe the recent price correction into the mid to high 30's is still in play in the short term and the 50 dollar price target is still in tact for end of year. This is just a guesstimate, I've been wrong more than I am right, but the upwards trajectory continues.

 A lot of you have been through the ups and down of PRPL with me. I wanted to give you my last DD before I focus on other investments. All of this DD is coming from two investor conferences that occurred in the last 48 hours. I am doing my best to summarize the key points.

**Just as a wakeup call for the idiots that say ""It's a mattress company."" This company is printing money.**

# There is no stopping Purple's Domestic Plans 

***PURPE IS OPENING A STORE every \~12 DAYS for the rest of the year.***

* PRPL is anticipating becoming the #2 Player in the industry and is targeting \~1.5B\~2B in revenue- this Move is expected to take 3-5 years.
* PRPL is looking at tons of Merger and Acquisitions and this could potentially be a strategy but this is not their focus.
* PRPL anticipates 30-36% Growth for this year (2021) to 840-880M
   * PRPL Capacity at the end of 2021 will exceed 1B on a capacity standpoint
* PRPL is nearly doubling their brick and mortar presence in 2021 alone
   * 1500 stores
* PRPL anticipates 20-30% for the 2022+ years----- 3 to 5 years worth of continued growth domestically.
* PRPL anticipates Foreign Expansion won't be their focus until late 2022/2023
* PRPL is in 1800 stores and commands on 3% market share but they believe they will continue to take market share even in a downturn.
   * Tempur-Pedic is in about \~8000 stores.
* PRPL expects that they will have \~1.3B to \~1.5B before expanding internationally
* PRPL has tons of opportunity for higher price points in bedding
* PRPL believes 50% of the market opportunity is outside of the USA.
   * PRPL is so confident that they aren't focusing on overseas expansion until 2022 with the real effort anticipated to be in 2023
* Expansion is looking to be omni-channel
   * There is headroom for tons of Mattress firms
   * ""All Premium"" retailers have reached out to purple
* There is enough door expansion that they wouldn't be able to support them
   * PRPL is pacing expansion to ensure they can service their customers

ESTIMATING EBITDA for next 3 to 5 years- I am using 12.5% as midpoint Purple indicated it could be as high as 15% in 3-5 years.

# THE REASON FOR THE DROP AFTER EARNINGS

* Purple indicated the miss was not due to competition it was due to soft guidance for Q1 as a momentum quarter
* Soft guidance for Q1 is due to the quarter being focused on getting ready for Q2 onward
* Q3 will witness most of the growth that bleeds into Q4
* There are supply constraints that have pushed some of the growth out- they are working through this.
   * The only constraint affecting purple is coils.
   * They are hand to mouth on coils and will need more coils
   * Purple is not worried about competition at this point as they are no where near close to saturation.

# Where could the Stock Price GO

I have provided 2 P/E ratios and I have used the 25% growth scenario to calculate EBITDA. Based on these numbers, we could see a price from 30-96. If they exceed this then it wouldn't be unrealistic to see 45-120 as the range in the next 5 years. 2021 is a little over estimated as compared to their guidance.

&#x200B;

[My rough estimates assuming EBITDA multiples of 20 and 25 and EBITDA Margin of 12.5&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/0ee72023rbm61.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce469b42deaefe1744a9d51be7df53e2d8abaf7a)

# Comparing to Tempur Sealy using a higher EV/Sales ratio

Tempur sealy has about 1.5B in debt ,so their Enterprise value is much higher than purple. Using EV/Sales as an indicator for PRPL, we could assume that 3x Ev/Sales due to PRPLS superior growth and it would put the stock price @ 37.00 based on 2021 revenue estimates, 46.00 based on 2022 estimates, 57.00 based on 2023 estimates, 72 based on 2024 estimates and 90 based on 2025 estimates.

&#x200B;

The Chart below is TPX (Tempur Sealy's current Metrics). Purple is growing much quicker and will likely command significantly better multiples.

# The Teslabro Fears the CanooTruck

I never imagined that I would spend so much time shilling for something that looks like it was designed in a Sanfransiscan Bath House but [today's leak](https://www.reddit.com/r/canoo/comments/m208cq/canoo_pickup_truck_leak_pics_and_specs_inside/) of Canoo Truck really pushed me into the zone of CanooBro fanboy.  This Lesbian Mystery Machine is so financially compelling that I am straight ""Jacked to the Tits"", as /u/effinwookie puts it, in GOEV calls.

**My current positions.**

1. 46 4/16 15$c - Original Sane Position
2. 20 3/19 17.5$c - Straight Gambling
3. 40 4/16 30$c - Retarded Yolo Gambling  Inspired by CavemanTurboChad /u/knyggaplease

I might be Blue collar fancy on the dab but I'm not as ""Jacked"" to the **Moontits** as the rest of the fucking market. There is a total of [98,725](https://u.teknik.io/nbcFT.PNG) open interest for March 19th Calls.... 9.8 Million Shares most of them out of the money.  Think about that...

I didn't even look at the puts... ^((Ok TBH after writing that  I just looked at the puts because I don't want to be wrong) )

Lets talk about today's trading and what Ortex tells us about short interest. Today we saw a gap opening which settled down into slow bullish trajectory that dipped into close. As I write this at 1900 3/10 I am going to predict that short interest grew as today (ortex lags a day in estimating short interest) trading was characterized by a price capping style where there always seemed to be a few hundred shares that appear out of no where.  This is encouraging and discouraging at the same time.

**Future Self finds** \-  Ortex [money shot](https://u.teknik.io/BvM6k.png)\- 3/11/201 - **Oh this is good!**

* **DTC Increased to 1.46**
* **Estimated SI Increased to 10.1 Mil!**
* **Utilization is 100**

edit - 3  (SI increasing with Price is confirmatory of my thesis there was significant price capping yesterday but they were unable to actually bring the price down.  The DTC increase is the most significant and we are looking like we are going to a gap open this morning)

I am highly encouraged that some shorts have covered yet others (or the same one) have/has opened new positions at a lower share price. Average age of shorting has increased over the past few days but this could just be that the new short positions ""weigh"" less than the older ones.  This digging in of the heels shows the power of the gamma ramp magnetism.

(Dark pools allow massive transactions of shares to occur without affecting the share price)

I consulted the **Godfather (AKA Cartesian Ghost AKA Hal Squarerootofnegative1)** about the fact that 2 Days ago someone purchased 5000 4/16 25$p  which this dark pool order perfectly matches. Someone is probably taking up a synthetic short position to hedge their bets against the share price increasing.  As the share price goes psycho the IV spikes so do the prices of Puts.     This is big time shit.. Retail is just along for the ride.   The Godfather advises that this is to essentially retain the freedom to maneuver and stay net neutral to ride the SP.  This is a bet that the SP will skyrocket in March and dip in April and then Continue to move up... Or April gave them the best vantage point to play the field... its probably /u/deepfuckingvalue

What is encouraging is that the pattern over the last few days has been gap openings met with  price capping and bullish long pressure to stabilize and push it.  (I actually think that monday we saw a recent short cover as we ran around the mountain and AVG age of shorts increased) We can see from the above chart what gap openings do to the price.  (A: MM have to buy more shares.)  Check the last few days we have seen an immediate spike in price on open with it settling down and then slowly rising as a long continues to push shorts, its actually straight warfare if you watch the L2 (and of course normal profit taking, day trading or retail or whatever its not all about short squeezing is it now).

**This makes me believe that Shorts are opening new positions lower but aren't willing to go hard in the paint...**  They are essentially just digging their heels in as they are being slowly shoved towards a cliff..

SI increasing slightly with SP increasing is confirmatory of this thesis.  I'll update in the morning

**Listen, What I am saying is that Someone or some people with 9 milly in Short Interest spent the last few months beating your stock like a rented mule and then went and spent that margin somewhere else thinking $GOEV was SPAC trash.

This ""Truck"" Leaked today (thank you /u/PlaneReflection)   After looking at this truck for one second I could only get so erect. This ""Truck"" was obviously designed by someone who has never seen a truck before because they were too busy playing fortnight. This is ok because there's genius here.

2. It has an extended cab
3. You can power tools off of it.
4. It is meant to bring Flyoverstate people into the EV world.
5. The subscription allows small businesses to scale fleet size.  This is unknown to people that live in LA and think people sanely work on roofs in the winter in the midwest or east coast.

(**I can't confirm this directly but reports from the front state the article originally just said truck leak yadda yadda cool story bro.)**  Then they went to go talk to the Chairman (Who cares about the CEO these days) who didn't answer them until the market closed and said, yeah **GigaChad Tesla Killer** will be made in a microfactory...

The song for today's post is **Burial and Four Tet - Moth (Forest Swords Remix).** Put it On.

**This post is not financial advice**. **I am not a financial advisor.**  I... I'll be honest, I am just a dude sitting here at his desk trying to figure this shit out. I feel like that I'm staring into this abyss full of monsters who promise me money but require my sanity in exchange. This market.... This fucking market.  Every single fucking cent of that stimulus will go straight into Robinbull or WeHood and make this crack smoking Market start huffing paint thinner as well. Welcome to the future. It looks like a 3rd world roller coaster and it's severe pimping of physics.  People are going to die having ""fun"".

If I am wrong about something call me out... I can take it.

# The Teslabro Fears the CanooTruck

I never imagined that I would spend so much time shilling for something that looks like it was designed in a Sanfransiscan Bath House but [today's leak](https://www.reddit.com/r/canoo/comments/m208cq/canoo_pickup_truck_leak_pics_and_specs_inside/) of Canoo Truck really pushed me into the zone of CanooBro fanboy.  This Lesbian Mystery Machine is so financially compelling that I am straight ""Jacked to the Tits"", as /u/effinwookie puts it, in GOEV calls.

**My current positions.**

1. 46 4/16 15$c - Original Sane Position
2. 20 3/19 17.5$c - Straight Gambling
3. 40 4/16 30$c - Retarded Yolo Gambling  Inspired by CavemanTurboChad /u/knyggaplease

I might be Blue collar fancy on the dab but I'm not as ""Jacked"" to the **Moontits** as the rest of the fucking market. There is a total of [98,725](https://u.teknik.io/nbcFT.PNG) open interest for March 19th Calls.... 9.8 Million Shares most of them out of the money.  Think about that...

I didn't even look at the puts... ^((Ok TBH after writing that  I just looked at the puts because I don't want to be wrong) )

Lets talk about today's trading and what Ortex tells us about short interest. Today we saw a gap opening which settled down into slow bullish trajectory that dipped into close. As I write this at 1900 3/10 I am going to predict that short interest grew as today (ortex lags a day in estimating short interest) trading was characterized by a price capping style where there always seemed to be a few hundred shares that appear out of no where.  This is encouraging and discouraging at the same time.

**Future Self finds** \-  Ortex [money shot](https://u.teknik.io/BvM6k.png)\- 3/11/201 - **Oh this is good!**

* **DTC Increased to 1.46**
* **Estimated SI Increased to 10.1 Mil!**
* **Utilization is 100**

edit - 3  (SI increasing with Price is confirmatory of my thesis there was significant price capping yesterday but they were unable to actually bring the price down.  The DTC increase is the most significant and we are looking like we are going to a gap open this morning)

I am highly encouraged that some shorts have covered yet others (or the same one) have/has opened new positions at a lower share price. Average age of shorting has increased over the past few days but this could just be that the new short positions ""weigh"" less than the older ones.  This digging in of the heels shows the power of the gamma ramp magnetism.

[GoevWhale Twitter](https://twitter.com/GoevWhale) found this Dark pool Order by [Dark Pool Melstone](https://twitter.com/MelStone31/status/1369353690566524934?s=20)

(Dark pools allow massive transactions of shares to occur without affecting the share price)

I consulted the **Godfather (AKA Cartesian Ghost AKA Hal Squarerootofnegative1)** about the fact that 2 Days ago someone purchased 5000 4/16 25$p  which this dark pool order perfectly matches. Someone is probably taking up a synthetic short position to hedge their bets against the share price increasing.  As the share price goes psycho the IV spikes so do the prices of Puts.     This is big time shit.. Retail is just along for the ride.   The Godfather advises that this is to essentially retain the freedom to maneuver and stay net neutral to ride the SP.  This is a bet that the SP will skyrocket in March and dip in April and then Continue to move up... Or April gave them the best vantage point to play the field... its probably /u/deepfuckingvalue

What is encouraging is that the pattern over the last few days has been gap openings met with  price capping and bullish long pressure to stabilize and push it.  (I actually think that monday we saw a recent short cover as we ran around the mountain and AVG age of shorts increased) We can see from the above chart what gap openings do to the price.  (A: MM have to buy more shares.)  Check the last few days we have seen an immediate spike in price on open with it settling down and then slowly rising as a long continues to push shorts, its actually straight warfare if you watch the L2 (and of course normal profit taking, day trading or retail or whatever its not all about short squeezing is it now).

**This makes me believe that Shorts are opening new positions lower but aren't willing to go hard in the paint...**  They are essentially just digging their heels in as they are being slowly shoved towards a cliff..

SI increasing slightly with SP increasing is confirmatory of this thesis.  I'll update in the morning

**Listen, What I am saying is that Someone or some people with 9 milly in Short Interest spent the last few months beating your stock like a rented mule and then went and spent that margin somewhere else thinking $GOEV was SPAC trash.  They woke up monday morning hung over from their month long Put party in a real bad situation and are now fighting like a cat over a fucking toilet to save themselves but you showed up with leather gloves on and a Surprise fucking truck and let the Gimp out of the cage... Didn't you... Fuck Yeah CanooBro... Fuck yeah. Velma Gonna Holla at ya'**

But for real Chairman of the Board ain't no fool.  I suggest you look him up.

# This truck upsets the TeslaBro.

This ""Truck"" Leaked today (thank you /u/PlaneReflection)   After looking at this truck for one second I could only get so erect. This ""Truck"" was obviously designed by someone who has never seen a truck before because they were too busy playing fortnight. This is ok because there's genius here.

**The highlights for me are**

1. You can fit a sheet of plywood in the back.
2. It has an extended cab
3. You can power tools off of it.
4. It is meant to bring Flyoverstate people into the EV world.
5. The subscription allows small businesses to scale fleet size.  This is unknown to people that live in LA and think people sanely work on roofs in the winter in the midwest or east coast.

(Cybertruck will release with the same level of reception as CyberPunk... Sick Burn Bro.)

**The money story,** and whats great about /u/planereflections drop, is that [Reuters wrote an article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-canoo-evs-pickup/ev-startup-canoo-plans-to-roll-out-american-built-pod-like-electric-pickup-in-2023-idUSKBN2B3010?il=0) about the truck leak.  (**I can't confirm this directly but reports from the front state the article originally just said truck leak yadda yadda cool story bro.)**  Then they went to go talk to the Chairman (Who cares about the CEO these days) who didn't answer them until the market closed and said, yeah **GigaChad Tesla Killer** will be made in a microfactory...  Oh by the way We're looking for states to put the factory in (IE Texas, perhaps texas and maybe... Texas). Oh Preorders Q2 2021. This news was updated 10 minutes before market closed.

1615427717.0,NEXT,"GOOD EVENING to all of my favorite little Crayon eating, piss martini drinking, diamond handed big NUTTED ape buddies,

Now I know that all of you little shit throwing apes that haven't been on this ride before were dropping fat donkey kongs in your Huggies this afternoon during the brief GME/AMC nosebleed. If you survived the slaughter, congratu-fucking-lations. If you bought the dip, you know the way, and are truly, one big fat diamond loving retard. If you paper handed or had stop-losses set, you're a bitch and the rest of us diamond hands thank you for exiting our rocket before we make our first landing on planet **$69,420.69**. The Tendieman is coming way faster than you think.

**The Hedgefunds**

Today, these stupid little shit fuckers really decided to show us their entire hand. They used the same short attack that they used previously, but not only did they do it so blatantly obvious, they did it across our beloved GME and AMC (THESE ARE THE ONLY PLAYS THAT MATTER, THEY DID IT ELSEWHERE TOO). This was the most obvious share-shake attempt that I've ever seen, and it was done more outwardly than the previous attempt. **THEY'RE SCARED, WE HAVE TO BE CLOSE TO INITIATING PHASE 1 OF THE MOASS.** As GME and AMC keep rising, they have to keep buying more and more shares to lose less money on the options that are ITM or will be ITM by the end of the week. They extra fucked themselves today with their bullshit attack. **They triggered the short sale restriction** meaning that tomorrow (for GME), they won't be able to orchestrate such a massive attack because they'll only be able to short shares during upticks; *but ape say ""if big back fat crying down his back Melvin just short on uptick won't it crash?""* **NO, BECAUSE GME UPTICKS EVERY .6969696996420 MILLISECONDS.** ***Tomorrow we will be able to BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY*** and these chicken shits won't be able to shake the shares out of the paper handed bitches as easily as they had today. I'd include pretty little pictures with colors for all of you crayon eating shits, but I know they mean nothing to any of us, **HODL.**

**The Media**

The media is so fucking crooked and tied in with these hedgies that they literally only speak when GME and AMC downticks 10-20%. All day long they were silent until the short attack, then all of the sudden our ""MEME STOCKS"" were worthy of mentioning. I think this is clear indication that they're being paid and gagged by these chode dicked chicken shit hedgies. In conclusion, don't listen to the media, don't listen to the articles, the analysts, or even your mother. **TRUST THE RETARD INSIDE YOUR HEAD.**

**The Crayon Eaters**

Foremost, I love you ape brothers. Many of you have been here from the start, and some of you may have even just joined today, but it doesn't matter so long as you HODL. **Together ape strong.** Remember that you are holding diamonds, everyday that you hold these diamonds you're costing Wallstreet and the egotistical bastards that stole from your families in 2008 billions and billions of dollars, but its nothing in comparison to what we will achieve when we take back *TENS of billions* of dollars from them. Getting rich is cool, but sticking it to the man and getting back what is rightfully ours is even sweeter. I've gained a sense of true happiness from these gorgeous little stonks, and I've already decided that IF these stocks go to zer-**HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHA FUCK THAT THESE BITCHES AINT GOIN' NOWHERE THEY'RE GOING TO THE GO FUCKING PARABOLIC AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET FILTHY RICH; THE RED PRICE NEXT TO YOUR SHARES IS THE DISCOUNT TO BUY MORE. HANG IN THERE, NO RETARDS LEFT BEHIND. WE ARE COMING BACK FOR YOU ALL ON THE WAY TO $69,420,696,696,696,420.696.**

**TL;DR**

Fuck the hedgefunds, their bitchass tricks didn't work today, it made things worse, and made us apes stronger. The media is as F.O.S as they've ever been and are doing anything they can to help their hedgefund sugar daddies out. **Apes together strong, HODL till $69,420,696,696,696,420.696.**

***Obligatory legal pardon:*** **Don't listen to me I never passed 3rd grade, I am not a cat, but I am a thoroughly convinced diamond handed ape who loves the stonk. Plainly, I am not a financial advisor.**

1615421676.0,PS,"TLDR: Fedex earnings is approaching March 18th, stock is down over 10% from its last ER when it reported its best quarter ever. This quarter will blowout expectations, the stock has completely flown under the radar on low volume, options are dirt cheap and average price target is $327 representing over 25% upside, 500%+ for March options assuming the price moves back to where it was right before last earnings. Positions at the bottom.

EDIT: One day after my post Goldman Sachs upgrades FDX to $356 price target with buy rating [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FDX/?RegistrationCode=SocialMedia-direct&utm\_source=GeneralSocialMedia&utm\_medium=Social&utm\_campaign=SocialMedia](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FDX/?RegistrationCode=SocialMedia-direct&utm_source=GeneralSocialMedia&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=SocialMedia)

Below are bulletpoints for DD on FDX, delivering you massive tendies going into their ER next week. My last DD was buying puts on $snow that was trading near $400 and now $230 today, resulting in 200%+ put profits ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow\_massive\_dilution\_incoming\_easy\_put/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow_massive_dilution_incoming_easy_put/)).

* Fedex reports earnings next Thursday, this quarter includes:
   * Record Black Friday shipping
   * Record Cyber Monday shipping
   * Vaccine shipping and just inked deal to deliver J&J vaccine
   * Record Holiday season shipping

1615421676.0,VERY,"TLDR: Fedex earnings is approaching March 18th, stock is down over 10% from its last ER when it reported its best quarter ever. This quarter will blowout expectations, the stock has completely flown under the radar on low volume, options are dirt cheap and average price target is $327 representing over 25% upside, 500%+ for March options assuming the price moves back to where it was right before last earnings. Positions at the bottom.

Aight you retards. This some serious shit we gonna go through. Strap in because the so called, ""2nd squeeze"" will be big, even though it isn't the squeeze we all know will eventually happen that will fk over HFs and allow us to finally land on Mars with Elon's rocket ship.

Alright, so looking at the chart for GME over the last 3 months, we can see there is a large spike after the initial run up, highlighted by the small white box before the large blue box. From corner to corner (closing prices for those days) is what I believe is the ""run up"" before the ""squeeze"" (just a metaphor). **This area goes from $19.95 to $43.03, or an increase of about 216% (x2.16).**

**Now, when looking at the blue box that follows, we can see that from corner to corner we have a price** **range of $43.03 to $347.51, or an increase of 808% (x8.08).** Now, when comparing the increases on both days, we can see that the 216% ""run up"" over a period of 7 trading days led an 808% gain, or a x3.74 increase. This means that for each day that passes within the ""run up"" is an increase in the multiplying factor by 0.534, resulting in our 808% increase for the apparent ""squeeze"".

*Just to double check, with that x2.16 increase of the run up, we can apply this and multiply by 3.74 (0.534 \* 7 days). This leads to the 808% increase that we calculated above.*

So, assuming that this x0.534 factor stays true, let's apply this to the recent ""run up"" we had starting 13 trading days ago.

Over this period of 13 trading days for the current ""run up"", **we have a range of $44.97 to $262.99, or a 585% increase (x5.85).**

Applying the ""run up"" factor of 0.534, **13 trading days \* 0.534 = 6.942 --> 6.942 \* 5.85 = 40.61.**

40.61 \* the closing price of today ($262.99) = A closing price of the height of the ""2nd squeeze"" of $10,680.02, or an increase of 4061%.

**TL;DR: We will have an increase of about 4000% during the apparent ""2nd squeeze"" to have a share price of $10,680.02. Hold the fking line.**

They did receive financing recently. I have no information what their collateral is but if it's cars- that's a depreciating asset in a changing market segment. When I look at their technical trends, I wonder what changed in 2015 / 2016 / 2017 when the slope of growth changed. PEST analysis can give you a few clues. Institutional Ownership has decreased approx 4.75% over the last 3 months and I suspect this trend will continue considering PE and Book Value Per Share.

IQ is undervalued and technically promising. It has a cocktail of factors similar to TSLA 4 months ago before the 1000% rise. If it breaks out of its current trading range, it can soar very high.

**Fundamentals**

iQIYI is currently the #1 video streaming site in China. Truly the 'Netflix of China', it has more users than any other platform. Competition is intense - Tencent and Alibaba have competitor platforms - but iqiyi is still number 1, and that gives them the opportunity to grow their lead.

IQ is a growth stock, currently being valued as if it isn't. It's heavily in debt - as you'd hope all growth stocks would be - and it continues to invest in producing original content, at the expense of more tangible assets. They don't seem to care about profit, and have very rough financials. This is typical for growth stocks with a high valuation - the valuation is usually based on speculation about the future. However, IQ has a low valuation. Speculation about the future is *not priced in*. Its market cap is just $22b. It is currently being viewed like a struggling company - which it isn't. This means it is highly susceptible to a huge change in valuation, just by viewing it as a growth stock and pricing in the value of the huge array of exclusive content, and more users than any other platform. This current valuation is insane.

IQ is also being shorted, based on some very, very, uninformed claims ('[faking their numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/08/iqiyi-accused-of-fraud-by-wolfpack-muddy-waters.html)' - a company surveyed people in China and basically didn't find as many using Iqiyi as their numbers would suggest. A completely unreliable unscientific study that used a tiny sample size (1500) and drew sweeping conclusions, aided by a single ex-employee, and some unspecified *'data'*, this is garbage, probably produced for self-promotion purposes among the Sinophobic investment crowd. This study launched an SEC investigation, which heavily suppressed the stock price, but the whole thing is simply ridiculous). Regardless, shorts get squeezed when the price goes up, whether they're right or wrong.

**TECHNICALS**

*IQ has been in a trading range for 2 years

*It has just closed at the very top of that range.

*Momentum has been VERY strong approaching this level - rising almost every day, even when related stocks/indicies fell.

If it breaks out of the range, it will soar - due to: 

1. The technicals (the end of the trading range leading to a breakout)
2. The short squeeze
3. That price rise causing reevaluation as a growth stock and pricing in the intangible assets.
4. Then, renewed interest and maybe even the hype it deserves.

**SUMMARY**

This is a growth stock being wrongfully viewed as a struggling company, beset by shorts and in a trading range for 2 years. This is *essentially the exact same scenario that Tesla ($TSLA) was in 4 months ago*, before its 1000% rise. If it breaks out, it can go very high.

If it doesn't break out, it will likely go down to the $15-$17 area at the bottom of the range.

Sounds fucking awesome right.  

The issuance was oversubscribed by $35 Billion no less.

But while that is nice and all, the devil is in the details.

The company still burns 30 million dollars a day paying people to do work that isn’t making the company money.

The leveraged away their customer loyalty programs to secure the deal.  Meaning while the massive debt they just paid away looks great, the point being is that their company will see less in profits for the entire time the debt stays on the books.

Travel may be in a slight upswing, but here is food for thought, what if kids and teachers are working over the summer to get caught up in academics and people travel much less than anticipated?  That’s a realistic situation facing this country because otherwise an entire generation of children is being left behind.

Also I’m not convinced people are going to jump out and travel, I think a lot of people will be reluctant to and start by seeing friends and relatives locally before actually taking on more adventurous steps.

Business travel, the most lucrative kind of travel, has basically be scrapped by all major corporations unless it’s completely necessary.

There still aren’t going to be conferences where professionals travel to this year.  It isn’t going to happen.  

This is a classic buy the rumor, sell the news event because the stock itself has issued more shares in the last year to dilute and already terrible and diluted earnings.

You can hope to see a recovery, but until that day actually comes, this stock has the ability to really fuck people that are long on hope.

With the stimulus bill signed today, there isn’t much good news left in the market to be priced in.

Oil prices are on a steady increase towards $100 a barrel, and the airline industry which was horribly strapped for cash and could not estimate fuel demand last year underhedged their exposure.  Even if travel comes back, I hate to break it to you, it won’t be the airline companies making money, it’s going to be the oil industry.

Financial advice? No.

So this looks exactly like January. We tanked, then got back up, it might very well be that we'll see the markets close around the 260 mark today.

In January, the markets opened the next day, the price shot back up, the scared ""HODL""ers sold to ensure some modest gains, the price tanked again. If that hadn't happened, we'd be past Saturn now.

&#x200B;

Here is my elegant conclusion:

You apes might be thinking of selling, now, but I encourage you to HODL through tomorrow's spike (do you like the stock or what?). We haven't had enough WS tears yet.

I expect that today happened because many bought in at 340 and cared about nothing else than to break even and to leave at least at 0. 🧻

We got rid of the cowards. HODL to the moon now.

Roblox was one company that benefited from 2020's lockdowns and social distancing measures, with social events held on its platform including concerts from Billie Eilish, Lizzo, and even the debut of a Lil Nas X single to 30 million viewers.

Roblox is trading under RBLX, with its direct listing to offer shares in the company to the public from March 10. It opened at $64.5 when it was estimated $45

1615403620.0,KOSS,"Hello WSB, this is my first official post, but I'm very proud to see how we have all HODL together really strong.

I have been in GME since 30 Oct 2019 with an additional 1670 shares on 29 May 2020 and I wish I could take a screenshot to prove my words, but my custodian account does not allow any screenshots out of ""security"" reasons. I currently hold over 6 digits of value in GME and I hope to reach my 7 digits and possibly 8. After what happened today, my 7 digits is certain, 8 digits possible. With more crayons maybe I'll reach 9.

That being said I like to share and encourage with everyone why this nosedive drop we seen today is actually the BEST affirmation we really need.

There's been wonderful DD that the Short interest are still extremely high and that the data in FINRA is entirely unreliable. Let's be honest, before what happened today, no matter how certain we are, we weren't 100% sure.

I'm an expert in Chinese history, and I'll quote Sun Tzu, the famed author recognised for writing the Art of War over 2000 years ago.

“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”

Truth is we never really knew what the hedges were up to and this week was really fishy, with the absence of obvious short ladders and peaceful markets. Other than occasional dips everyday after reaching a peak, we couldn't tell much. Some people have speculated that maybe the hedges were buying calls in order to reduce their risks, but I think we can all agree now that there is a good possibility that the dips we've been seeing the last few days are just a test for hedges to see how much the price can be affected.

And let's be honest with ourselves, that was a coordinated attack. I have no idea how long they have planned that, but looking from what we've seen, it's definitely a lot of time. At that scale it's not possible for 1 or 2 hedge funds to pull this off by themselves. And YET!! This is where we recovered strong.

So what this means is this. The hedges are panicking. They are worried. And they have proven that the shorts *HAVE NOT BEEN COVERED*. If they have been covered to the large extent they claimed to, today's coordinated attack wouldn't have happened.

Not just did they admit with their actions that they are fearing us, they also basically highlighted to us what stocks they are all massively shorting. AMC, KOSS, NOK, BB all are in this together with us GME Army! 

You know it's like Harry Potter, where Voldemort basically handed the weapons to Harry by his own hands.

Based on Chinese History, there's this clever strategist Sun Tzu. For him before he executes any clever maneuvers for war, he will always test them first. If the hedges we are up against are the same smooth brain people like Sun Tzu, this fall is only a test. But it's costly to them and we have held strong. With the current prices, supposing they did buy some shares to cover their losses, all those buys from 180 to 250 are all gone. Now they are forced to buy shares above 260 and its only going to cost them even more. Much better for us.

Fellow apes, they are really afraid of our gamma squeeze this week and next week.

Now... We strike back, by doing NOTHING!

[to the skeptics who need proof for everything](https://imgur.com/a/aTaF8j6)

I obviously have better things than to post everything on social media like a attention seeking person. I'm a retarded ape not a peacock. Your tongues will wag too no matter what even if my picture has shown my platform to be ancient. But that's nothing to do with my investing preferences. 

For you skeptics who need proof for everything and choose to always doubt and flake, here it is. ""A confident man does not live for the applause and approval of the non-worthy"". Your skeptical outlook has only said to me that you clearly did not see Gamestop for what it really was earlier on, and even if DFV's DD was shown to you in those days, you were a late adopter. It has also shown me that you have the paper hands tendency when you don't see potential and when the going gets tough. 

I thought I have surpassed and ignored most silly comments, but thanks to the 1% of negative words, you have helped me see I still react to silly nonsense and it's something I need to change in myself. You are a Hyena and this is a community of apes. Reflect on yourselves.",Why I'm super happy to watch evil hedgies shave 1/3 of GME and AMC,m25szi,402,5340,0.96,5340,0,,Discussion,False,True,1

1615403490.0,OPK,"“$200 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be general senior unsecured obligations of the Company, will pay interest semiannually in arrears at a rate of 4.50% per annum” The conversion price of these bonds is $4.22 which is a discount of the current stock price. The number of shares that these bonds would be converted to is a little over 470,000 shares. This also states that convertible bond holders are receiving 4.5% interest annually which is a healthy number when considering other bond offerings. As a result of the healthy interest, it would be assumed the bond holders would not elect to convert and instead choose to receive the healthy interest year over year.

“The Notes will be convertible into, at the Company’s election, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and common stock” This gives OPKO Health the opportunity to use the profits generated from the unforeseen pandemic revenue and pay off the bonds in cash. This would lower shares outstanding and help minimize dilution.

“The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to February 15, 2022, but may redeem the Notes, at its option, on or after February 15, 2022 if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price for the Notes for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period.” This states that OPKO Health can close out these convertible bonds anytime after 2/15/2022 if the stock price is above $5.48 for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days.

So now that the facts of the convertible bonds are laid out, I want to share my thesis off of my DD. This is one idiot’s opinion and should not be taken as advice. These convertible bonds act as insurance for anyone that holds them. The convertible bond holders are able to open massive short positions to hedge against $OPK defaulting on their loan. If $OPK defaulted, their stock price would plummet, and the bond holders would lose out on their principal they paid for the bonds but they would make a much larger amount of money on their short positions. If the opposite happens and $OPK reaches full potential and the stock price rises gradually, the bond holders will slowly cover their short positions and will simply cash in on their convertible shares or the cash, whatever $OPK elects to give. So we have big money players with hand in both the short and long positions and they don’t care which way the stock price goes because they will make a lot of money either way.
The catch here is that $OPK has done great work in the past year and was profitable in 2020. They are accumulating cash and will hopefully be able to pay of the convertible bonds in cash. The pandemic was unforeseen, and things have changed. Some convertible bond holders have most likely been covering their short positions and going long, while others still might be hedging against their bonds that they hold.
Long story short, February 2022 will be when $OPK can free themselves from the manipulation from these bond holders. The biggest thing though is that these bond holders know their time is limited to close out their short position. They have been gradually doing so and we have seen 40,000,000 short shares be covered in the past few months. These bond holders are hoping the true value of $OPK can be suppressed until they have enough time to cheaply cover their hedged short positions. The main take away is that $OPK can close out these bonds with cash. This would mean if stock price were to correct to fair values, they may lose on covering their shorts combined with $OPK paying off the bonds in cash and not shares.

I say let’s squeeze them out of their rigged game and make them actually feel the pain of losing in the market. We need diamond hands that have enough DD to know that $OPK is extremely undervalued at these levels. Let’s make these shorts and convertible bond holders scared of the power of the common people.",$OPK : OPKO Health’s Convertible Bonds that are often used by shorts to fear monger,m25r3j,13,12,0.68,12,0,,DD,False,True,1

1615403333.0,DAX,"Dear fellow retards and crayon-eating apes,

Today I would like to present you my first DD of a German DAX company: Deutsche Telekom, the mother company of $TMUS, which got recently included in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio by legend Warren Buffett. I would like to show you why I think that Deutsche Telekom is even a better buy than §TMUS.

**1) Solid figures, strong strategic market position, and growth outlook. Main growth drivers are an increasing glass fiber rollout potential and its 5G/cell tower portfolio.**

Deutsche Telekom is the biggest European integrated telecommunications company, with some 242 million mobile customers, 27 million fixed-network lines, and 22 million broadband lines. Deutsche Telekom is present in more than 50 countries, with its main business in Germany and US. On February 26, 2021 the Deutsche Telekom published its results for the 2020 financial year:

* Increase in **revenue of 25.4 percent to 120.1 bn. $ /101.0 billion euros**
* Adjusted **EBITDA AL increased by 41.6 percent to 41.7 bn. $/ 35.0 billion euros**
* **+388,000 broadband customer** additions in Germany
* Larger T-Mobile US records **5.5 million postpaid customer additions**
* Guidance for 2021: **adjusted EBITDA AL of around 37 billion euros** (44.1$) and **free cash flow AL of around 8.0 billion euros (9.5 $)**

The **earnings forecast shows a growth of roughly 13.2% per yea**r over the next years. The general outlook is positive.

**2) Market capitalization of Deutsche Telekom is far below its fair value with a 132 to 194% stock price potential**

Based on 2020 figures, the industry ratio of market capitalization and annual revenue for the big US players lies in a range between 1.24x to 2.24x, with a Top 3 average of 1.77x:

* **$TMUS T-Mobile US**: 153.2 bn. $ market cap / 68.4 bn. € annual revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **2.24x**
* **$ VZ Verizon Communications:** 234.5 bn. $ market cap / 128.3 bn. $ revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **1.83x**
* **$T AT&T Inc.**: 212.8 bn $ market cap / 171.8 $ revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **1.24x**
* **Deutsche Telekom:** 91.5 bn. $ market cap / 120.1 bn. $ revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **0.76x**

A fair value for Deutsche Telekom based on the Top 3 industry average of 1.77x would lead to a **fair share price of** **44.64$/37,53€,** which is a **premium of 132%** compared to the current share prices of 19.22$/16,16€. Applying the ratio of its subsidiary §TMUS of 2.24x would even lead to a **stock price potential of 194% resulting in 56.5$/47.50€ share price**. The price-to-earnings ratio is 17.6x and below the industry average of 25.3x (source: [simplywall.st](https://simplywall.st/)).

**3) The market capitalization of US subsidiary TMUS is worth 65.9 bn.$ - so the remaining business of Deutsche Telekom is worth half its revenue!**

After the Sprint-merger, Deutsche Telekom owns 43% of all shares of its subsidiary TMUS, with an option to buy the remaining 8% from Softbank until June 2024 (half of the shares for 06/2020 TMUS stock price of roughly 100$). Based on today’s value, the TMUS participation is worth 65.9 bn. $, which is already 72% of Deutsche Telekom's overall market cap. So, the remaining international business of DT with **51.7 bn. $ revenue is only evaluated 25.6 bn. $!**

**4) The analyst outlook is very promising, showing a conservative 27% upside potential over the next 12 months**

Based on 13 analyst reports, the 12 months forecast shows a possbile stock price of 24,40$/20,50€, which is a premium of roughly 27% to today's stock price. The range across all analysts is between 20.23$ (Deutsche LB) and 29,25$ (JP Morgan Chase) including 12 Buy and 1 Hold recommendations.

**5) A high dividend yield of roughly 4% over the past 20 years makes it the most stable and reliable German dividend stock.**

**6)** **Risks:**

To me, a comprehensive DD should also cover the risks involved, especially when outlook and forecast seems too good to be true,

* During the dot-com bubble, Deutsche Telekom showed a crazy race towards its ATH of 120$/100€ in 2000, followed by a crash down to 12$/10€ within the next two years. This led to trauma for many German shareholders, resulting in lethargic stock performance over the past 18 years. The high dividend yield is also a result of this crash, with management trying to please the remaining stock owners. Since DT is a German symbol of the dot-com bubble, there might be a chance that the stock is simply not reacting to the current, positive news.
* Deutsche Telekom has a high net debt of 127.4 bn. $/107.1 bn. € (2020). However, the recurring cash flow is high, covering roughly 22.2% of its debt. The interest payments are fully covered by the profit (3.1x coverage).
* Currently, 14.5% of all shares are owned by the German government which might hamper potential positive share price developments. However, German economics minister Peter Altmeier is considering reducing the German participation (January 2021). Other privatization cases show a positive stock price effect.

**Summary:**

Based on all information available, I believe that the upside potential overweighs possible downsides. Even a conservative estimate of 24,40$/20,50€ target stock price reflects a 27% price premium. I personally believe that a **fair estimate based on financial analysis would be 44.64$/37,53€, resulting in a 132% stock price performance**.

* From the image above you can gather the following information
   * This stock has a P/E of 7.5 way way way low - this is price to earnings for you apes that are still on the gorilla teet and barely understand market cap.
   * They pay a 2.00 dividend which is a 3.5% yield. Just owning the stock you will make monies.
   * They are small, 1.5B market cap, but profitable.

# The comparison to peers!!!!!!!!!!

* Look at the chart below
   * it's P/E is way better than the industry average.... 7.5 vs 21 this is incredible.
   * It's Price to cash flow is 8x better.
   * It's price to sales is nearly 9x better....... This is absolutely insane.
   * Price to sales is 4x better
   * Price to book is 6x better this

I am not a financial analyst- just my two cents. This came on my radar from a SA article. I believe the author is correct that this could double in the short term.

1615388359.0,ASO,"Academy Sports is a sports and out door chain that saw 139% earnings surprise last earnings announcement and is currently the third most shorted stock at almost 40%. If you think there was institutional influence holding down GME, you haven't seen anything yet. 

ASO has a much smaller float, 32 million, compared to GME's 50m, SKT's 90m, and RKT's 106m. It also has a much smaller average daily volume, compared to the other most shorted stocks, at 1.5 million. Although $40 options just opened up, previously the only OTM options were $25, $30 and $35. If you look at the last few weeks price at expiry you will see, for instance last week, that at expiry the price was just below $25 and immediately went up past $25 after the options expired worthless. 

This is a company that had a breakout earnings beating both earnings and revenue and has another earnings announcement coming this month. Last earnings was so great because of the increased sales of guns, ammo, and out doors equipment from the quarter ending October 1. The last quarter of 2020 saw an increase in the sales of guns and ammo across the board. It also saw more school sports increase as states start to re-open. So far this quarter, which will not be in the earnings report, we saw the third highest increase in gun sales. We also see Texas and other states that are big ASO earners completely re-open. 

Getting back to institutional shenanigans. Not only do you see the price fall below the $25 call weekly on low volume trades, despite running up the day or week before, but you can also see price suppression daily. Look at the average volume of Monday's 13% run up, and then look at the volume it took to drive it back down to $25 on Tuesday. If you look at the daily chart for the past month you will see a roller coaster ride of 1-3% ups and downs hourly. Each time I've seen something like this it was either institutions ""shaking out weak hands"" or GME's first pop. 

I understand that most are diamond handing GME and it may have room to run, but I believe that not only is ASO over-shorted and will have another stellar earnings driving the price higher causing a squeeze, but that it is a fundamentally undervalued company.

1615388266.0,VS,"We the apes, in order to create a more perfect union, do solemnly swear to present to you all the due diligence that you will need to make an informed decision. Join me on this journey fellow banana chasers.

TLDR; AMC is being heavily shorted; AMC has potential to go to $40  Time to save AMC and make tendies while we’re at it. This is not financial advice; it was originally written in red crayons that I found shoved deep inside my nose. 

Ever since COVID came along and kept our wives' boyfriends from taking them to the movies, hedge funds have been shorting AMC. AMC was close to meeting its demise on several occasions until the sound of apes screaming “We like the stock!” could be heard. The sounds grew louder with the cult-like chants. However… one thing was missing: More Apes. This is where we come to you with the facts laid out smoother than your brain in hopes of showing you what could be the best investment decision of your life. Bananas will be flowing. Question is: Will you grab it or… peel out?

First we will start off by reminding everyone that this is not investment advice, it is just the opinion of a few smooth-brained apes who like the stock, just like you. Now, why are we diamond handing AMC? 

**AMC has solid momentum.** To back this up you can look at the chart for this. The average volume has significantly increased. Months ago, the stock rarely had more than 10M traded a day. Now it's harder to find a day with less than 100m traded shares. In the same time frame, the price has gone from almost $2 to, at the time of this writing, $9.29. This means there’s more interest and liquidity in the stock. All good things for us. 

**Theatres are reopening.** A quick google search gives you dozens of links for theatres that have already opened their doors and allowed moviegoers back in to enjoy their favorite pastime. Biden has [stated](https://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour/watch/biden-all-u-s-adults-will-have-a-covid-vaccine-by-may-101867589951) that there will be enough vaccines for everyone by May, which will allow all theatres to open at full capacity. 

**Capital raised, debt reduced.** In January AMC raised $1.2b ← with a b, in funding and paid off $600m in debt. Which leaves them with a clean bill of health and a solid ground to build up from.

**Started A Streaming Service.** They have branched out into [streaming services](https://www.amctheatres.com/about/on-demand) as well, with AMC Theatres On Demand. 

**The Chart Below Looks Amazing.** First off, it's showing a cup and handle as indicated with the yellow line. This is a bullish pattern for price and we officially broke out of the handle to the upside on March 8. If we break above the tip of the cup, there isn’t much resistance stopping AMC from filling a gap to $13 and continuing on to the $20 mark, which is where Vlad decided to manipulate (read:suppress) buying action in January.
Next, we have the elliott wave theory that AMC does a great job of following. At the very least, AMC looks like it will move up from $9 to $13; on the smaller degrees. But on the larger degrees, if we assume that Wave 1 was the January spike, then we are in the beginning of Wave 3, which under EW Rules, has a realistic target of $30-40. With enough volume, AMC could easily blow past the $13 up to $20 and eventually reach the $30-$40 range. 

https://i.imgur.com/ramEhoQ.png

**Blockbuster movies lined up/Pent up Demand.** With movies not being able to be seen in theaters, some have been put on the release back burner until they can get sufficient eyes to view them. Some of these movies include Coming 2 America, God VS King, Mortal Kombat, Black Widow & Tom Gun: Maverick.

**The discord bot don’t lie.** If it worked for DFV it can work for us!

https://i.imgur.com/nmbRPmi.png

**Short Seller Data:** Forget about the momentum and the technicals for a minute and lets talk ape to ape. We did some research and found that there is still a TON of short sellers on AMC trying to take our movie theaters away. They just won’t learn; we LIKE the stock; we LIKE our movie theaters; we WANT them to stay in business. Forget the technicals, AMC is a great buy & hold because it will keep a fundamental aspect of our social fabric intact. If theaters close down, where else will our tweens make their first sloppy moves? And don't you dare say microwave popcorn is better than the theater kind - yes, even after your wife's boyfriend reminds you he ""doesn't do salt.""

Comparing AMC to GME, AMC is being shorted a lot heavier than GME right now; the numbers don’t lie.  Take a look at what Harambe found: 

https://i.imgur.com/w6WCJag.png

Sources: Data in table from Ortex.com, iBorrowDesk.com, and fintel.io

**Fellow Smooth Brained Ape Definitions Key:**

**Free Float:** Number of shares available for trade
**Short Interest:** Number of tradable shares being shorted
**Utilization Rate:** Percentage of lendable shares that have been borrowed (most likely to short)
**Short Borrow Fee Rate:** The interest rate each borrower pays on shares borrowed for shorting purposes
**Days to Cover:** The estimated number of days it will take for shorts to cover their positions

**Harambe’s Heavenly Thoughts:** Although GME has a higher percentage of its shares on loan, AMC has more shares on loan in total that are being shorted (Compare GME’s 12M shares with AMC’s 67M shares shorted). On AMC, the shorts have already borrowed 100% of the shares available to borrow, while on GME is only at 72%. We looked at the data from January, and saw a similar spike in GME’s utilization, followed by a rapid drop before the price mooned. AMC seems to be setting up a similar scenario. Looking at the short borrow fee rate, it is now more expensive to short AMC than it is to short GME, which could increase the pressure on AMC shorts to cover. Also, AMC has a higher “Days to Cover” than GME, which means it will take shorts longer to cover, so the price spike could last longer.  What Harambe’s trying to say here is: Me like AMC. Apes stronger together. AMC to the moon.

tl;dr: The writers and DDers of this:

>Me, Ape 1: 1 contract, 90 shares. Bagholding some at $15 but bought in more at $10. 

>Ape 2: 40 contracts, 600 shares

>Ape 3: 8 contracts, 100 shares

>Ape 4: 59 spreads, 6 contracts

>Ape 5: 40 contracts, 100 shares

>Ape 6: 400 shares, 10 contracts

>Ape 7: 69 contracts, 1361 shares.

There are now several trillion dollar companies. The new asset class that didn't exist a few years ago which must not be named here is worth well over a trillion. GME, well fucking GME, Hertz, all that shit. This is what the end of a [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp) looks like. The gains during the final stretch are unbelievably high. With the returns from the market recently, it begs the question if the bull market is coming to an end.

## Blow-Off Top

A “blow-off top” is when the price of a stock or general market increases sharply, only to be followed by an as sharp decrease in price.

>*A blow-off top is a chart pattern that shows a steep and rapid increase in a security’s price and trading* [*volume*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp) *followed by a steep and rapid drop in price usually on significant or high volume as well.*[*Investopedia*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blowofftop.asp)

As a bull market nears its ends, the gains are too good to miss out on. As people buy into the market, fearing they will miss out on gains, it drives the price up to unstable values. Investors who have been in the market long enough, take their profits. As people start to sell and lock in gains, the price drops, causing a frenzy as others try to get their money out before the price goes even lower.

## Why the Current Rally Might End

The S&P 500 had its longest bull run in history ended in February because of the coronavirus. After a decade of steady gains, things came crashing down in a little over a month. Now the market is back like it never left. The market is up 65% since it bottomed out less than a year ago. *65% return in less than a year!*

The S&P closed in October at $3,269. It closed the first week of January at $3,824. That is a 16% gain in 2+ months.

[Tesla has been on another level lately](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/elon-musk-just-became-the-richest-person-6a0675911677). Not only did they [dominate 2020 ](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/2020-stock-market-review-b736a4ecff67)by returning 700%, the stock was up another 22% in the first week of 2021. How much more steam does this thing have?

As stock prices keep soaring, when will people start to realize profits? Some may be inclined to take their profits now while others may still in and not want to take their gains until it is too late.

When Q4 earnings start getting announced, how will the market fare? Will analysts be happy if companies' top or bottom lines are still too far from pre-pandemic numbers?

With stocks at all-time highs, it may seem the risk is greater than the reward going into the next few weeks.

## Why The Bull Market Will Likely Continue

Which of the many reasons do you want to hear first?

I’ll start with the latest from Joe Biden, as [NBC News said](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/joe-biden-wants-set-aside-deficit-concerns-invest-ailing-u-n1253638),

>\[Biden\] favors [setting aside concerns about the federal deficit](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/biden-s-agenda-gets-fighting-chance-after-democrats-capture-senate-n1253305) in order to spend more money to boost the ailing American economy.

This is on top of the nearly $4 trillion the US government has printed out in stimulus money in 2020. Easy money means easy profits right? As more money has been circulated, it has found its way to the stock market and inflated prices. With more government stimulus coming there is reason to believe the stock market will react the same.

And as we know, the stock market looks to the future. What’s in the past doesn’t matter. The millions unemployed, rising coronavirus cases, growing debt, potential inflation, or slowing global growth is history. We have vaccines now. The end is in sight.

The news of vaccines and thoughts of a “normal” society in the [second half of 2021](https://medium.com/technology-hits/why-google-can-be-the-best-performing-tech-stock-of-2021-25dff4a73fc7) is music to investors' ears. With life back to normal and an open economy, people will abandon these record-high saving rates and go back to increased spending, which should benefit companies and therefore stock prices.

Need a [technical reason](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/three-technical-indicators-for-beginner-investors-to-know-3d06758e9d82) to think the market is not topping off right now? Look at the chart of the S&P 500 from any time to today. 1 month, 1 year, 1 decade, 1 century. Sure there are some downturns, but it always comes back and sets new records.",The market is in the middle of a “Blow-Off”,m1sixx,31,10,0.55,10,0,,Discussion,False,True,0

1615354787.0,AMZN,"First we can take a quick walk through the history of how this all started, and explain how none of what's happening was ""our fault"". GameStop had, admittedly, followed a pretty outdated business model since the early 2010s. The gaming industry, like many others, was moving digital and Gamestop lagged far behind this trend.

Hedge funds, rightfully so to an extent, began shorting Gamestop in 2016. They began shorting it around $40 and rode the wave down. But they kept getting more and more greedy. Yadda yadda, sub-$4 and 140% short.

Deep Fucking Value, Michael J Burry and others saw how undervalued Gamestop was at $4, and they started buying and HODLing shares. Just how undervalued were they when people started catching on in 2019/2020? Well, at the end of 2019, Gamestop had about $1.6B in cash and about $800M in debt - or a net cash position of +$800M. The market cap of Gamestop was $276M when the share price was $4. Completely ignoring any future cash flows, you could purchase a share worth nearly $12 in cash for $4. *Hedge funds were still shorting the stock at this point.*

Skip forward, Ryan Cohen becomes the catalyst that Sparks the shitkeg of short squeeze that hedge funds created, and off we went. Ryan Cohen, and his team, are the key. And what this thesis relies on **is already happening.**

Ryan Cohen and his team have begun taking over the board in what seems to be an amicable fashion. At least in the sense that it is not a hostile takeover. They've already ousted their dead weight CFO and have put in motion the new company vision to be an e-commerce retailer first, physical location game distributor second. That seems like a difficult transition to make...

Except Gamestop already has an online presence, already does e-commerce, has over 56 million subscribers to their online membership and increased their e-commerce sales by nearly 400% YoY **BEFORE Ryan Cohen became involved.**

So what's so special about Ryan Cohen? Well.. let's chew on that question for a second. *He turned a pet good company into a $30billion+ e-commerce giant.* Which gets us into the fundamentals. How does the market typically value e-commerce businesses? Many of them don't actually make a profit every year. They're valued based on future growth potential, usually based on a multiple of sales. Because e-commerce doesn't come with the overhead of physical retailers, investors will tolerate negative earnings in order to invest in rapid sustained growth, counting on them eventually becoming profitable.

Let's start with Chewy. In 2020, they did $6.46B in revenue and -$174M in net income. They're trading at a market cap of almost $34B, which is just over five times their revenue. Seems fairly reasonable.

Let's check in on our favorite gaming destination. In 2020, they did $5.16B in revenue and -$275M in net income. Not far off from Chewy, especially when you consider how much of Gamestop was still brick and mortar during a pandemic (oh and Chewy being fully e-commerce during a pandemic). GameStop, even after today, is trading at a market cap of $17B, which is just over three times revenue.

So two e-commerce companies. One built by Ryan Cohen, and one currently being led by Ryan Cohen. Trading at very different multiples. If we applied Chewys multiple to Gamestop, we would get a market cap of about $26B or a share price of about $377. That's a fair market value shareprice. **$377**. That does not consider a gamma or short squeeze at all. That is simply an efficient market pricing it as it should be valued.

Let's check some other e-commerce companies to make sure we are being reasonable.

- EBAY trades at a multiple of 3.72 times revenue
- ETSY trades at a multiple of 15.11 times revenue
- PINS trades at a multiple of 23.20 times revenue
- AMZN trades at a multiple of 4.00 times revenue

There are clearly outliers, on the high side. Industry norms are typically 3-5x revenue for established businesses. When you anticipate strong near-term growth, as in the case of ETSY and PINS, you can see significantly higher multiples.

Using these valuations, we can confidently say that Gamestop is currently flirting with the low end of fair value, and has about 40% upside if we view them as an established business without extraordinary growth expectations. Except. We kind of do expect them to grow.

Have I mentioned that nobody is considering their access to the e-gaming industry? Becoming a sponsor, or even facilitator of e-sporting events. Leagues, championships, etc. E-sports is a global industry that currently sees about $1B in revenue annually. This is expected to grow exponentially over the next decade, with most projections putting growth at 50-60% within the next two years, and continuing beyond that. Gamestop already has a Gamestop Performance Center, which is essentially a venue used for hosting major e-sporting events, as well as a host for training facilities. They've already tapped the market before Ryan Cohen, and his team will be able to truly capitalize on the market.

Then we have live streaming, and potential acquisitions. At some point, it's likely that they will do an offering to raise capital. Spoiler, they don't currently need capital, but could deploy equity capital toward specific initiatives. Like purchasing an established platform to distribute electronic game downloads. Or purchase an established platform for live streaming. These initiatives don't have to be through acquisitions, but if they choose to, they will be able to afford to.

Oh yeah, PC gaming as well. It's been confirmed by several here and elsewhere that Gamestop is adding a feature to many of their stores. A ""Build-A-PC"" workstation. You can buy parts and build your PC in the store. The PC gaming industry is currently $38billion annually. It's expected to grow another 10% in the next few years. Another industry with rapid growth potential that Gamestop has already tapped into.

What does this all mean? It means that if we consider Gamestop to be an e-commerce retailer with modest growth potential, the fair market value is somewhere between $230-385 a share. If we got wild and said they had the growth potential of something like ETSY, they would be worth $1,121 per share. I'd say they have room for more than modest growth, but not quite the potential of ETSY. Let's use about 5.6 as a multiple which would give us a **fair market value of $420 per share.**

#Tl;dr: Based on Gamestops full commitment to being an e-commerce retailer, the fair market value of the company is between $15-26billion, or a share price of $230-385.

By the way, this is completely ignoring the fact that we are in the midst of repeated small gamma squeezes and a looming mother of all short squeezes. As a long term investment, Gamestop has the potential to be trading close to and above $400 per share. That is if the market is truly efficient and values Gamestop **based on fundamentals and no outside factors.**

If we applied Chewys multiple to Gamestop, we would get a market cap of about $26B or a share price of about $377. That's a fair market value shareprice. **$377**. That does not consider a gamma or short squeeze at all. That is simply an efficient market pricing it as it should be valued.

Let's check some other e-commerce companies to make sure we are being reasonable.

- EBAY trades at a multiple of 3.72 times revenue
- ETSY trades at a multiple of 15.11 times revenue
- PINS trades at a multiple of 23.20 times revenue
- AMZN trades at a multiple of 4.00 times revenue

There are clearly outliers, on the high side. Industry norms are typically 3-5x revenue for established businesses. When you anticipate strong near-term growth, as in the case of ETSY and PINS, you can see significantly higher multiples.

Using these valuations, we can confidently say that Gamestop is currently flirting with the low end of fair value, and has about 40% upside if we view them as an established business without extraordinary growth expectations. Except. We kind of do expect them to grow.

Have I mentioned that nobody is considering their access to the e-gaming industry? Becoming a sponsor, or even facilitator of e-sporting events. Leagues, championships, etc. E-sports is a global industry that currently sees about $1B in revenue annually. This is expected to grow exponentially over the next decade, with most projections putting growth at 50-60% within the next two years, and continuing beyond that. Gamestop already has a Gamestop Performance Center, which is essentially a venue used for hosting major e-sporting events, as well as a host for training facilities. They've already tapped the market before Ryan Cohen, and his team will be able to truly capitalize on the market.

Then we have live streaming, and potential acquisitions. At some point, it's likely that they will do an offering to raise capital. Spoiler, they don't currently need capital, but could deploy equity capital toward specific initiatives. Like purchasing an established platform to distribute electronic game downloads. Or purchase an established platform for live streaming. These initiatives don't have to be through acquisitions, but if they choose to, they will be able to afford to.

Oh yeah, PC gaming as well. It's been confirmed by several here and elsewhere that Gamestop is adding a feature to many of their stores. A ""Build-A-PC"" workstation. You can buy parts and build your PC in the store. The PC gaming industry is currently $38billion annually. It's expected to grow another 10% in the next few years. Another industry with rapid growth potential that Gamestop has already tapped into.

What does this all mean? It means that if we consider Gamestop to be an e-commerce retailer with modest growth potential, the fair market value is somewhere between $230-385 a share. If we got wild and said they had the growth potential of something like ETSY, they would be worth $1,121 per share. I'd say they have room for more than modest growth, but not quite the potential of ETSY. Let's use about 5.6 as a multiple which would give us a **fair market value of $420 per share.**

#Tl;dr: Based on Gamestops full commitment to being an e-commerce retailer, the fair market value of the company is between $15-26billion, or a share price of $230-385.

By the way, this is completely ignoring the fact that we are in the midst of repeated small gamma squeezes and a looming mother of all short squeezes. As a long term investment, Gamestop has the potential to be trading close to and above $400 per share. That is if the market is truly efficient and values Gamestop **based on fundamentals and no outside factors.**

1615350151.0,EA,"PSA $RBLX Direct Listing opens on 3/10. 

From Bloomberg

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roblox-direct-listing-reference-price-221415677.html


“The New York Stock Exchange set a reference price of $45 for the direct listing of Roblox Corp., the online games company that originally planned to go public via a traditional initial public offering.


Roblox’s shares will begin trading Wednesday without the company raising any capital. As with previous direct listings, the company won’t issue new shares at a set price. Instead, current investors can simply begin selling shares based on demand when trading opens.”

This means that current share holders who paid $2.50 a share can start selling at $45 per share, as long as demand holds up.  

Sooooo, therefore if we don’t buy it day one, we can buy it cheaper later on. . 

And their financials : 


For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Roblox had a consolidated net loss of $197 million on revenue of $614 million.

They pull in around 200m a QTR but overspend by about $60m a month.    Eeesh.  Huge losses.

Compare this to EA Games, which has a similar market cap ($30bln) but over the same period had sales of $4bln and net PROFIT of 900m (almost as much as RBLX’s total revenue).

Before plowing your wife’s boyfriends . . Money . . Into $RBLX take a careful compare / contrast w other companies in the same industry.  Hugely profitable and popular Minecraft sold for $10 bln.  Is $RBLX really worth $30 BLN day 1 with 0 earnings?

1615349030.0,FB,"I’m thinking of going all in on Roblox tomorrow morning, so I’m doing my DD as I type this up.

Roblox made $923.9 million of revenue last year 2020 - but reported a loss of $253.3 million....

Roblox is NOT currently profitable.

Paying the Roblox content creators 30% of revenue is $277.17 million (almost what they posted as loss, which is fishy), but leaves $696.73 million of revenue.

So let’s try to figure out Operating Expenses...

7 executives according to https://corp.roblox.com/people/ - whom are reportedly very well compensated. But I think the website is out of date, or skimmed on purpose - I’m a tech infrastructure guy and I know of Dan Williams hired at Roblox in 2017 (moving from Dropbox, before that Facebook) to tackle their infrastructure issues - https://corp.roblox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TechCrunch-Ron-Miller-How-Roblox-Completely-Transformed-its-Tech-Stack.pdf More on him and the infrastructure later.

So this site says that they are up to 26 executives- https://craft.co/roblox/executives

Ok, let’s low ball at $3 million a year each exec (unknown bonuses) (https://fintechzoom.com/fintech_news_roblox/heres-how-much-robloxs-executives-and-cofounders-make/ ) minus $78 million = $618.73 million revenue.

They currently have 960 employees. https://www.barrons.com/articles/roblox-sets-date-to-go-public-through-a-direct-listing-51614036401

953 non exec employees. Some are in China, some make more than others. Majority have a Silicon Valley engineering salary, benefits + perks - let’s estimate and say those 953 employees average a cost of $300k a year. That’s another $285.9 million in employee wages, leaves us with $332.83 million left of the revenue for 2020.

$332.83 million estimated left in revenue plus the reported $253.3 million reported loss for 2020 is still $586.13 million left to cover.

Data Center + migration costs. Back to Dan Williams. His purpose was to reduce the infrastructure costs by moving everything they could off of AWS and Windows servers. AWS cloud provider costs + running everything on Windows servers with a cost of license per server - is fucking expensive. My best guess and hope for investing is that this cost is what got rolled up into the $253.3 million reported loss for 2020. This meant setting up 5+ year contracts with Data Center and POP co-location providers (point of presence, where the Comcast, Verizon, etc ISPs hand off their internet traffic). Roblox wouldn’t have the FB type cash to build their own data centers, so you are talking about $30k a month lease per site. At least 8x Data Centers in the US with 1-3 POPs per DC. ~24 contracts at $30k a month = $8.64 million a year. Similar costs in China, maybe - I dunno the network layout there or how things go with dealing with Chinese government, hence the deal with Tencent.
The cost for populating these Data Centers and POPs with hardware, and performing the migration is the upfront expensive part. Buying the server hardware, buying the network equipment - paying for your own network transit instead of leasing from AWS. Heavy upfront costs, but much much cheaper in the long run than AWS bills.

But I cannot figure anything that would add up to $586.13 million, even if they were giving blank checks and made subpar deals with vars and vendors where everyone got a very hefty cut to make things happen fast and smooth. I also don’t know what existing contracts they might have had to break / pay off to go the route that would be best going forward.
I’m gonna rough estimate $150 million on infrastructure equipment and another $150 million on contracts and vendor costs. $586.13 million minus that very rough $300 million brings me down to ~$286 million of costs unaccounted for (again, almost their reported loss - still fishy).

And I doubt they have been able to move all of their services off of AWS - which means they still pay AWS bills, and depending on what services those are - they could be hefty bills.
I do know that if Roblox had planned better from the start - they wouldn’t even be going public. Optimized servers and back end code on free Linux distos, even running on a cloud provider - would be profitable with their volume. Look at Steam...

So, long term:
Roblox has almost 300 open job positions https://corp.roblox.com/careers/ between US and China. They are pushing hard to expand into China through a ownership partnership with Tencent (look them up if you are not into gaming). They are actively working to right the ship and they have hired high level executives and engineers who have past experience producing results for other Fortune 100 companies.

I spent this time to look into things I was questionable about and still the $253 million loss on ~$1 billion revenue. I didn’t fully answer my own questions, but got a reasonable explanation for myself.

I’m not selling my GME or rest of my folio to go RBLX - but I am going to go in with what I’ve got tomorrow am. I’m a high risk, short term profit guy - so that’s I’m betting on. But this could still be the direct listing IPO that tanks after opening.
